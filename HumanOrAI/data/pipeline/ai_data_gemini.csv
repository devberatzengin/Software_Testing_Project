"This study introduces a novel deep learning architecture, the Harmonic-Voicing Variational Autoencoder (HV-VAE), for the unsupervised analysis of tonal harmony. By leveraging a disentangled latent space, our model separates the abstract harmonic function from its concrete chordal voicing. We trained the HV-VAE on a large corpus of digitized Bach chorales represented as piano-roll matrices. The model learns a continuous, low-dimensional manifold where one axis corresponds to diatonic function (e.g., tonic, dominant) and orthogonal axes represent parsimonious voice-leading transformations. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates superior performance in chord labeling and functional analysis tasks compared to traditional Hidden Markov Models and standard VAEs. Furthermore, qualitative analysis of the latent space reveals topologically coherent structures mirroring established music-theoretic concepts, such as the circle of fifths and neo-Riemannian transformations. This approach provides a powerful computational framework for exploring the hierarchical relationship between abstract harmonic syntax and surface-level acoustical realization.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Disentangling Harmonic Function and Voicing in a Variational Latent Space
"The perceptual phenomenon of orchestral timbre blending, central to the art of orchestration, has remained computationally elusive. This research investigates the acoustic correlates of successful instrumental blending through a hybrid psychoacoustic and machine learning methodology. We compiled a dataset of dyadic instrumental combinations, rated for their blend quality by expert listeners. A comprehensive set of audio features—including spectral centroid, spectral flux, harmonic entropy, and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)—was extracted from each audio sample. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, trained on these features, achieved high accuracy in predicting perceptual blend ratings. Feature importance analysis revealed that similarity in spectral envelope and temporal attack characteristics are primary predictors of successful blending. The findings challenge traditional orchestration treatises that emphasize harmonic series alignment, suggesting instead that dynamic spectral congruence is the dominant factor. This model provides a quantitative tool for composers and a new empirical basis for orchestration theory.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,A Psychoacoustic and Machine Learning Approach to Orchestral Timbre Blending
"Generating stylistically coherent polyphonic music with deep learning models remains a significant challenge, particularly in maintaining long-range contrapuntal integrity. This paper proposes a novel generative architecture, the Polyphonic Graph Transformer (PGT), which models musical voices as nodes in a dynamic graph. By explicitly representing the relationships between concurrent melodic lines, the model can apply attention mechanisms not only temporally but also inter-vocally. We trained the PGT on the complete J.S. Bach Well-Tempered Clavier, encoding the music in a symbolic piano-roll format augmented with voice-crossing and intervallic information. The model learns to respect species counterpoint rules implicitly, minimizing parallel fifths and octaves while promoting melodic independence. Objective evaluation using statistical measures of voice-leading smoothness and harmonic dissonance shows a significant improvement over standard LSTM and Transformer-based models. Subjective listening tests confirm that compositions generated by the PGT possess a higher degree of musical coherence and stylistic authenticity.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Contrapuntal Consistency in Polyphonic Music Generation using Graph-Based Attention Networks
"Iannis Xenakis's pioneering work in spectral and stochastic music challenges conventional analytical paradigms. This study presents a computational analysis of his seminal orchestral piece, *Metastaseis*, focusing on the quantification of its characteristic mass effects and glissandi. We employ a non-stationary Gabor transform, a variant of the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) with adaptive windowing, to achieve high temporal and frequency resolution simultaneously. This allows for precise tracking of the microtonal trajectories of individual instrumental lines within the dense orchestral texture. By analyzing the time-varying spectral density, we algorithmically segment the work into distinct textural clouds and mathematically model their evolutionary dynamics. Our results provide empirical validation for Xenakis's own sketches, which map glissandi to ruled surfaces, and reveal a deeper structural logic based on the statistical distribution of spectral energy. This methodology offers a new lens for the analysis of post-tonal, texture-based compositions.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Spectral-Temporal Analysis of Xenakis's 'Metastaseis' through Non-Stationary Gabor Transforms
"The complex rhythmic structures (talas) of South Indian Carnatic music present a significant challenge for automated analysis due to their improvisatory nature and micro-rhythmic variations. This paper introduces an unsupervised method for the discovery and classification of tala patterns directly from audio recordings. The approach utilizes an onset detection function to extract a percussive event time-series. Subsequently, we employ a novel subsequence Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm to identify recurring rhythmic motifs without prior knowledge of tempo or meter. These motifs are then clustered using a density-based algorithm (DBSCAN) to group performances by their underlying tala. The system was tested on a large dataset of Carnatic percussion solos, demonstrating high accuracy in identifying the principal talas such as Adi, Rupaka, and Misra Chapu. This data-driven methodology transcends the limitations of template-based approaches, offering a robust tool for large-scale cross-corpus analysis in computational ethnomusicology.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Unsupervised Discovery of Rhythmic Cycles (Tala) in Carnatic Music using Subsequence Dynamic Time Warping
"Musical expression is conveyed through nuanced deviations from a score's nominal instructions. This research proposes a hierarchical Bayesian model to disentangle the sources of expressive variation in piano performance, specifically microtiming and dynamics. We model a performer's rendering of a note's onset time and velocity as being drawn from distributions whose parameters are conditioned by multiple hierarchical levels of musical structure: the individual note's metrical position, the local harmonic context, and the global phrase structure. The model was trained on a corpus of expert performances of Chopin mazurkas, aligned to their symbolic scores. Through Bayesian inference, we can estimate the relative contributions of these structural factors to expressive choices, such as phrase-final lengthening or agogic accents on harmonically significant chords. This probabilistic framework not only provides a powerful descriptive tool for performance analysis but also functions as a generative model capable of synthesizing stylistically plausible, expressive performances from a neutral score.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,A Hierarchical Bayesian Model of Microtiming and Dynamics in Expressive Piano Performance
"The predictive coding theory of brain function posits that perception arises from minimizing prediction errors. We apply this framework to model the experience of tonal expectation in music. Our model, implemented as a hierarchical recurrent neural network, learns the statistical regularities of Western tonal harmony from a large symbolic corpus. Crucially, the input representation is not symbolic pitch-classes but a psychoacoustically-motivated auditory spectrogram, allowing the model to learn relationships based on acoustic, rather than abstract, features. The model continuously generates predictions about the forthcoming auditory stream. The magnitude of the prediction error—the discrepancy between the predicted and actual input—is interpreted as a neural correlate of musical surprise. We validated our model by correlating its prediction error signal with listener ratings of surprise for a series of harmonically ambiguous chord progressions. The results demonstrate a strong positive correlation, supporting the hypothesis that predictive processing is a core mechanism of music cognition.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Modeling Tonal Expectation and Surprise using a Predictive Coding Framework with Auditory Representations
"Automatic Music Transcription (AMT) and source separation are intrinsically linked but often addressed as separate tasks. We propose a unified, multi-task deep learning framework that performs them jointly. Our model utilizes a U-Net architecture, common in image segmentation, adapted for time-frequency representations of audio. The network takes a mixed audio spectrogram as input and outputs multiple channels simultaneously: an estimated spectrogram for each target instrument and a multi-pitch piano-roll activation map. By learning to separate sources and transcribe notes in a shared latent space, the model leverages synergistic information; knowledge of an instrument's presence aids transcription, and detected pitches inform the separation mask. Trained on the MedleyDB dataset, our joint model significantly outperforms pipelined systems where separation and transcription are performed sequentially. This end-to-end approach demonstrates superior robustness in highly polyphonic and dense instrumental textures, marking a substantial advance for complex audio analysis tasks.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Multi-Instrument Polyphonic Transcription via Joint Source Separation and Pitch Detection with a U-Net Architecture
"Geometric models of music theory provide powerful abstractions for understanding voice-leading and harmonic structure. This paper extends these models to the analysis of post-tonal repertoires by employing methods from Topological Data Analysis (TDA). We construct point-cloud datasets from the pitch-class sets present in compositions by Schoenberg, Webern, and Ligeti, embedding them within a toroidal voice-leading space. Using persistent homology, we analyze the topological features (e.g., loops, voids) of these point clouds across multiple scales. Our analysis reveals distinct topological signatures for different composers and stylistic periods. For instance, Webern's music exhibits a high prevalence of one-dimensional cycles corresponding to his frequent use of inversionally-related trichords, a feature not prominent in Ligeti's micropolyphonic textures. This TDA-based approach quantifies intuitive notions of musical coherence in atonal music, providing an empirical method for comparing compositional strategies not captured by traditional set-theoretic analysis.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Topological Data Analysis of Voice-Leading Spaces in Post-Tonal Music
"The transition between vocal registers (e.g., chest and head voice) is a critical aspect of vocal pedagogy, yet its acoustic markers are complex. This study employs glottal inverse filtering to separate the vocal source (glottal airflow) from the vocal tract filter (formants) in recordings of elite operatic and pop singers performing ascending scales. We analyze changes in glottal source parameters, including the open quotient (OQ), speed quotient (SQ), and harmonic richness factor (HRF), in conjunction with vocal tract resonance (formant) tuning strategies. Results indicate that operatic singers execute register transitions with minimal perceptible change by maintaining a consistent glottal adduction and strategically tuning F1 and F2 formants. In contrast, pop singers often utilize an abrupt shift in glottal configuration, resulting in a distinct timbral change. These findings provide quantitative, production-based evidence for different pedagogical approaches to register management and offer a robust framework for computational analysis of vocal technique.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Acoustic Correlates of Vocal Register Transitions in Operatic and Pop Singing using Glottal Inverse Filtering
"This paper introduces a novel computational framework for automating Schenkerian analysis from symbolic music representations. Traditional approaches struggle to capture the multi-level hierarchical nature of Schenkerian graphs. We reconceptualize the problem as a graph-to-graph translation task, modeling musical scores as primary graphs and their corresponding Schenkerian reductions as target graphs. Our proposed model employs a hierarchical Graph Neural Network (GNN) with iterative attention mechanisms to learn the complex prolongational and contrapuntal relationships that define structural levels (foreground, middleground, background). Trained on a curated corpus of expert analyses, our system demonstrates high fidelity in identifying fundamental structures (Ursatz) and key prolongational spans. The GNN-based approach significantly outperforms previous rule-based and statistical methods, offering a scalable solution for large-scale structural analysis and providing new empirical insights into the principles of tonal coherence and hierarchical listening.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Automated Schenkerian Analysis via Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks
"The precise tuning systems, or temperaments, used in historical performance practice are often a subject of scholarly debate. This research presents a probabilistic method for identifying historical temperaments directly from polyphonic audio recordings. We formulate a Bayesian inference model where the temperament is a latent parameter set governing the fundamental frequency relationships of concurrent tones. Using a sophisticated pitch-tracking front-end, we extract partial frequencies and model their likelihood given various historical temperament specifications (e.g., Pythagorean, quarter-comma meantone, well-temperaments). A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is used to efficiently explore the parameter space and estimate the posterior probability distribution over a dictionary of temperaments. When applied to recordings of historically informed performances, our model correctly identifies the documented temperament with high confidence, providing an empirical tool for musicologists to verify performance practice and analyze the sonic consequences of historical tuning decisions.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Bayesian Inference of Historical Temperaments from Polyphonic Audio Recordings
"The relationship between orchestration and harmonic function remains a theoretically rich but computationally underexplored domain. We propose a deep learning model to quantify this relationship by mapping instrument combinations to a structured latent space. A β-Variational Autoencoder (β-VAE) is trained on a large dataset of orchestral excerpts, learning a continuous, low-dimensional embedding from spectro-temporal audio features. Our results demonstrate that this learned timbral latent space is highly organized: distinct clusters emerge corresponding to specific harmonic functions (e.g., tonic, dominant preparations). Furthermore, geodesic paths between points in the manifold correspond to perceptually smooth timbral interpolations. This geometric representation allows for a quantitative analysis of orchestrational conventions, providing a novel empirical framework for theories of instrumentation and enabling generative applications such as timbre-aware harmonization and automatic orchestration based on harmonic context.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,The Timbral Latent Space: A Variational Autoencoder for Probing Orchestrational-Harmonic Covariance
"The concept of metric dissonance, encompassing both grouping and displacement dissonance, provides a theoretical framework for rhythmic complexity but lacks robust quantitative models. This study introduces a data-driven method for decomposing and quantifying metric dissonance from musical onsets. We represent rhythmic passages as high-resolution inter-onset interval (IOI) histograms, capturing the periodicities present in the signal. We then apply a constrained Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithm to these histograms. The NMF decomposes the complex IOI distribution into a set of basis vectors, or 'rhythmic prototypes,' and their corresponding temporal activations. Our findings show a strong correspondence between these learned prototypes and the constituent pulse streams that create metric dissonance (e.g., 3-against-2). This unsupervised decomposition provides a granular, quantitative measure of dissonance types and their evolution, offering a powerful analytical tool for complex polyrhythms in diverse musical idioms.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Decomposition of Metric Dissonance using Constrained Non-Negative Matrix Factorization on Inter-Onset Interval Histograms
"Neo-Riemannian theory offers a powerful group-theoretic model for understanding chromatic harmony, yet its standard operators (P, L, R) are limited in scope. We propose a generalized geometric framework that measures the distance between any two chords based on the principle of optimal transport. Chords are represented as probability distributions on a continuous toroidal Tonnetz manifold. The Wasserstein distance, a metric from optimal transport theory, is then computed between these distributions, quantifying the minimal 'work' required to transform one chord into another. This metric intrinsically models parsimonious voice-leading for transformations of any complexity, subsuming canonical Neo-Riemannian operations as special cases. Empirical evaluation against datasets of Western tonal music demonstrates that the Wasserstein distance correlates more strongly with established principles of harmonic syntax and perceptual smoothness than traditional voice-leading distance metrics, offering a more nuanced and extensible model for harmonic analysis.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,A Geometric Framework for Neo-Riemannian Analysis using Optimal Transport on the Tonnetz

We employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract geometric features from scanned images of Lutosławski's 'aleatoric counterpoint' sections, coupled with a recurrent neural network (RNN) processing spectro-temporal features from corresponding audio performances. An attention-based alignment mechanism learns the correspondence between specific graphical gestures and resultant sonic textures across multiple interpretations.

"The classification of microtonal tuning systems from audio signals is a challenging task due to the immense diversity of possible scales. We present a novel approach that eschews precise frequency measurement in favor of analyzing the global geometric structure of pitch relationships. Audio signals are transformed into time-series of chroma vectors, which are then aggregated into a high-dimensional point cloud. We apply techniques from Topological Data Analysis (TDA), specifically persistent homology, to compute a 'topological fingerprint' of this point cloud. The resulting persistence diagram, which captures the lifespan of topological features like loops and voids at different spatial resolutions, serves as a robust, scale-invariant signature. Our experiments demonstrate that this signature can effectively distinguish between various classes of tuning systems—including different equal temperaments, just intonation systems, and non-octave scales—without any prior knowledge of their theoretical construction.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Topological Fingerprinting of Microtonal Systems via Persistent Homology of Chroma Point Clouds

Trained on a large symbolic corpus of Western tonal music, the model computes the information content (or surprisal) for each event in a novel musical passage. This quantitative measure reflects the cognitive effort required to process an event given the learned statistical regularities of the style. In a series of listening experiments, we found a significant positive correlation between the model's calculated information rate and human subjects' real-time ratings of tension and surprise. This provides strong empirical support for the hypothesis that musical affect is deeply intertwined with the information-theoretic processing of probabilistic melodic structures, validating Leonard Meyer's seminal theories in a quantitative framework.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,An Information-Theoretic Approach to Musical Expectation using Adaptive K-Trie Prediction Models

Each polyphonic excerpt is encoded as a directed acyclic graph where nodes represent notes and edges represent melodic and harmonic intervals, weighted by their rhythmic context. The problem of finding a specific contrapuntal pattern (e.g., an imitative motive) is then cast as a weighted subgraph isomorphism problem. By employing a state-of-the-art constraint-solving algorithm, we can efficiently search a large corpus of motets by composers like Josquin des Prez for instances of a query pattern, including transformations such as inversion and retrograde. The system successfully rediscovers known contrapuntal devices and uncovers previously unannotated structural relationships, demonstrating the efficacy of graph-based representations for scalable, deep analysis of complex polyphonic textures.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Contrapuntal Pattern Discovery in Renaissance Polyphony via Weighted Subgraph Isomorphism
"The accuracy of automated harmonic analysis is often degraded by timbral mixing in complex audio signals. Conversely, source separation can benefit from high-level musical knowledge. We propose a synergistic model that performs both tasks simultaneously within a unified joint optimization framework. Our approach is based on Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) of the audio spectrogram. The framework is constrained by two interconnected priors: a harmonicity prior that encourages source spectra to consist of harmonically related partials, and a music-theoretic prior that biases the temporal activations of sources toward combinations that form coherent chord progressions according to a hidden Markov model (HMM) of tonal syntax. By jointly optimizing the source spectra, their activations, and the underlying chord sequence, our model significantly outperforms pipelined approaches. It achieves cleaner source separation and more accurate chord labeling on dense orchestral and jazz recordings, demonstrating the power of integrating low-level signal processing with high-level musical structure.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Synergistic Source Separation and Harmonic Analysis through Joint Spectrogram Factorization

The deformation term in the SYK Hamiltonian corresponds to a specific matter field in the bulk that violates the averaged null energy condition, thereby stabilizing the wormhole throat. Our analysis of the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) reveals a suppression of maximal chaos, consistent with the non-trivial causal structure of the traversable wormhole.

The Unruh thermal noise experienced by Rob transforms the quantum channel into a depolarizing and dissipative one, leading to entanglement sudden death at a finite acceleration. Here, we propose a protocol to counteract this degradation. By characterizing the Bogoliubov transformation that links the Minkowski vacuum to the Rindler vacuum, we model the Unruh effect as a specific quantum channel. We then construct a pre-compensating unitary operation that Alice can apply to her qubit before Rob's acceleration begins.

We demonstrate that, with a properly scaled noise level, the resulting estimator is asymptotically normal and its variance approaches the Cramér-Rao lower bound as the privacy budget ε grows. The crucial step is the calibration of the perturbation variance to the Fisher information of the model, which optimizes the statistical utility for a given privacy level. This allows for the construction of Wald-type confidence intervals with asymptotically correct coverage. Our method bypasses the need for complex and often sub-optimal post-processing or bootstrap techniques, providing a direct and theoretically grounded approach to private inference for a wide class of statistical models.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,Asymptotically Efficient Confidence Intervals under Differential Privacy via Calibrated Objective Perturbation
"Gaussian processes (GPs) provide a principled framework for spatio-temporal modeling but are hindered by prohibitive computational costs for large datasets. We propose a scalable and flexible variational inference (VI) framework for spatio-temporal GPs with non-stationary covariance kernels. The model's non-stationarity is achieved by defining the kernel parameters as a function of spatial and temporal covariates through a deep neural network. To ensure scalability, we employ a doubly stochastic variational inference approach, utilizing inducing points in both space and time. The key innovation is a structured inducing point parameterization based on a Kronecker product of spatial and temporal basis functions, which exploits the spatio-temporal structure to render the evidence lower bound (ELBO) and its gradients computationally tractable. This structure avoids the cubic complexity of standard VI for GPs. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on synthetic and large-scale climate science datasets that our method achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance while being orders of magnitude faster than competing methods.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,Scalable Variational Inference for Spatio-Temporal Gaussian Processes with Non-Stationary Kernels
"In longitudinal studies, subjects may experience recurrent non-fatal events in the presence of a terminal event, such as death, which censors the recurrent event process. Analyzing these correlated processes is challenging. We propose a flexible semiparametric joint model that connects a multiplicative frailty model for the recurrent event rate with a proportional hazards model for the terminal event. The dependence structure between the shared frailty and the survival time is explicitly modeled using a copula function, accommodating a wider range of association patterns than standard shared frailty models. We develop a penalized partial likelihood estimation procedure, where the baseline hazard functions are approximated by cubic B-splines. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators, including consistency and asymptotic normality, using modern empirical process theory. The finite-sample performance is evaluated through simulation studies, which show minimal bias and good coverage rates.

"We propose a dynamic extension of the stochastic block model (SBM) for analyzing the temporal evolution of community structures in longitudinal network data. Unlike existing dynamic SBMs that assume discrete community transitions, our model posits that each node possesses a continuous latent trajectory within a low-dimensional Euclidean space. The probability of an edge between two nodes at any given time point is a function of their positions in this latent space, thereby inducing a time-varying community structure. We introduce a variational expectation-maximization (VEM) algorithm for scalable inference, which simultaneously estimates the latent trajectories and the model parameters. The methodology naturally handles missing edges and node arrivals/departures. We prove the consistency of our estimators under a high-dimensional asymptotic regime where the number of nodes and time points grow. The model’s effectiveness in capturing smooth community evolution and identifying change points is demonstrated on synthetic networks and a real-world network of international relations.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,Dynamic Stochastic Block Models with Node-Specific Latent Trajectories for Longitudinal Networks

We frame the problem of distributional regression using the theory of optimal transport (OT). The proposed method models the Wasserstein barycentric projection of the response distributions as a function of covariates. This approach provides a geometrically meaningful way to define a conditional mean in the space of probability measures. To overcome the computational burden of traditional OT, we employ an entropically regularized version of the Wasserstein distance, leading to a computationally efficient estimation procedure based on the Sinkhorn algorithm embedded within a gradient-based optimization scheme. We establish the statistical consistency of our estimator and demonstrate its robustness to noise and outliers compared to methods based on quantile regression or moment-based approaches.

"Variable selection using non-convex penalties like SCAD and MCP is known to possess superior theoretical properties compared to the LASSO. However, performing valid statistical inference (e.g., p-values, confidence intervals) on the selected model parameters remains a formidable challenge. This paper develops a rigorous framework for post-selection inference for models fitted with a general class of non-convex regularizers. We construct a debiased or desparsified estimator by projecting the initial penalized estimator onto a low-dimensional subspace defined by the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the optimization problem. We prove that this debiased estimator is asymptotically normal under standard regularity conditions, enabling the construction of valid confidence intervals and hypothesis tests for the regression coefficients. Our theory extends the polyhedral-based approaches for selective inference to the non-convex domain. We demonstrate via simulations that our method maintains nominal coverage probabilities and provides higher power than competing methods, offering a powerful tool for interpretable and reliable inference in high-dimensional sparse linear models.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,Post-Selection Inference for Sparse Regression with Non-Convex Penalties: A Desparsification Approach

Our model, based on a microscopic Hamiltonian incorporating quasi-particle tunneling and coupling to bulk phononic modes, goes beyond simple phenomenological descriptions. By employing a Keldysh non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, we calculate the fidelity of braiding operations as a function of temperature, magnetic field inhomogeneity, and gate-voltage noise. The results reveal a non-trivial power-law dependence of the logical error rate on temperature, deviating from the expected exponential suppression and highlighting the critical role of non-local charge fluctuations.

We explicitly construct bulk local operators deep within the AdS geometry from boundary CFT operators, showing that their commutation relations are preserved up to corrections exponentially suppressed in the bulk depth. Our construction reveals that the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for entanglement entropy is a direct consequence of the minimal cut-surface in the MERA tensor network.

This paper presents a rigorous security proof within the composable security framework, demonstrating robustness against both photon-number-splitting and Trojan-horse attacks. We further analyze the protocol's performance under realistic conditions, including finite-key effects and detector saturation.

By tuning the incident photon energy to the Ru L₃-edge, we selectively probe dynamic spin correlations. Our data reveal a broad, V-shaped continuum of magnetic excitations, a hallmark signature of itinerant Majorana fermions emerging from fractionalized spins. This continuum persists above the magnetic ordering temperature, indicating the presence of robust fractionalized excitations in the paramagnetic phase.

We map the transition line in the T-μI plane, identifying a crossover from a hadronic phase to a pion-condensed phase and subsequently to a quark-gluon plasma. We precisely locate the pseudo-critical temperature for chiral symmetry restoration, observing its decrease with increasing μI, consistent with chiral perturbation theory predictions at low μI.

A carefully designed sequence of resonant laser pulses deterministically adds single photons to the growing graph state, with entanglement mediated by the emitter's spin state. We perform a full quantum master equation simulation, including realistic noise sources such as cavity loss, spontaneous emission, and spin dephasing.

Using time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (t-DMRG) simulations for systems up to L=64 spins, we study the evolution of an initial product state. In the MBL phase, we observe the characteristic logarithmic growth of entanglement entropy and the freezing of local observables, confirming the breakdown of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). Critically, we identify a many-body mobility edge—an energy density threshold separating localized and thermal eigenstates within the same system. We demonstrate that the long-time dynamics depend crucially on the energy density of the initial state, showing ergodic behavior above the edge and localized behavior below.

The adaptive strategy iteratively updates the phase estimate and modifies the interferometer's reference phase to maximize the Fisher information gained in each measurement. This feedback loop allows the protocol to dynamically allocate resources to the most sensitive phase regions. For N ≈ 4 average photons, we achieve a phase uncertainty scaling as N⁻¹·⁵, significantly outperforming the N⁻¹ Heisenberg limit for coherent or squeezed states.

Our results show that, unlike the scalar field case, entanglement harvesting from the Dirac field is highly sensitive to the spin degrees of freedom and the local spacetime curvature. We find a non-monotonic dependence of harvested entanglement on the detectors' separation and proximity to the forming event horizon. Notably, the fermionic nature of the field fundamentally alters the conditions under which entanglement can be extracted, providing a new probe into the vacuum structure of quantum fields in gravitational backgrounds.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Kuantum,Generated,Entanglement Harvesting from the Dirac Field in Curved Spacetime

The proposed method employs Neyman-orthogonal moment functions to mitigate the regularization bias induced by machine learning-based estimation of nuisance parameters, such as conditional expectations of proxies. We establish the asymptotic normality and semi-parametric efficiency of the PDML estimator under specific sparsity and identifying assumptions related to the proxy-confounder relationship. Our framework accommodates a wide range of machine learning estimators for the nuisance components, providing a doubly robust approach to causal estimation.

We construct a positive definite kernel derived from the Wasserstein-barycenter representation of diagrams, effectively linearizing the space of persistence diagrams and enabling the application of classical multivariate statistical techniques. This Wasserstein-Barycentric Kernel (WBK) captures the similarity of topological features with greater fidelity than existing persistence-based kernels. We demonstrate how this framework facilitates robust two-sample hypothesis testing via permutation tests on kernel-induced distances, as well as supervised learning tasks like regression and classification.

The HDHP integrates a Hierarchical Dirichlet Process for inferring a shared set of topics with a multivariate Hawkes process to model the intensity of topic occurrences as a self-exciting point process. The arrival of an event associated with a specific topic endogenously increases the probability of future events of related topics, thus capturing influence and temporal clustering. We derive an efficient collapsed Gibbs sampler for posterior inference. Applied to corpora of academic citations and social media communications, the HDHP provides more coherent topic evolution narratives and demonstrates superior predictive likelihood compared to static and discrete-time dynamic topic models.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,Hierarchical Dirichlet-Hawkes Processes for Dynamic Topic Modeling in Relational Event Networks

Our approach employs a penalized spline smoothing framework to reconstruct individual trajectories and formulates the estimation of the population-level covariance structure within an iterative expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The core innovation lies in the conditional expectation step, which optimally pools information across subjects to estimate the underlying smooth functions. We establish theoretical guarantees, including the consistency and convergence rates for the estimated eigenfunctions and scores under mild regularity conditions.

The model specifies a sparse precision matrix for the idiosyncratic components, estimated via a graphical LASSO penalty that reflects a known or estimated underlying network structure (e.g., geographic or economic proximity). Estimation proceeds via a novel block-coordinate descent algorithm that alternates between Kalman filtering/smoothing for extracting latent factors and a penalized likelihood optimization for the graph-structured covariance. This approach yields more efficient factor estimates and more interpretable loadings. We derive the asymptotic properties of the estimator under increasing cross-sectional and temporal dimensions.

"Variational Inference (VI) is a principal method for scalable Bayesian computation, yet its performance is often limited by simplistic approximating distributions and high computational costs. Geometric VI improves accuracy by exploiting the Riemannian geometry of the variational family but exacerbates the computational burden. We introduce Amortized Geometric Variational Inference (AGVI), a framework that marries the accuracy of geometric VI with the efficiency of amortized inference. AGVI trains a deep neural network (an inference network) to map observations directly to the parameters of the variational posterior on a Riemannian manifold. Optimization of the evidence lower bound (ELBO) is performed using natural gradient updates, which are efficiently approximated via properties of the inference network without requiring explicit inversion of the Fisher information matrix. This procedure learns an inference map that generalizes to new data, making posterior approximation nearly instantaneous at test time.

We propose the Deep Kernel Competing Risks (DKCR) model, a flexible, non-parametric framework that leverages the strengths of deep learning and kernel methods. The DKCR model uses a recurrent neural network to learn a rich, time-dependent feature representation from the covariate history. This learned representation is then input to a kernel-based regression model to non-parametrically estimate the cause-specific hazard functions, thereby avoiding restrictive modeling assumptions. A novel loss function based on the composite partial likelihood for competing risks enables end-to-end training.

"The Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD) estimator is a highly robust method for parameter estimation and outlier detection in multivariate data. However, its direct application to matrix-variate data via vectorization is suboptimal, as it ignores the inherent row and column covariance structure and is vulnerable to cell-wise, rather than case-wise, contamination. This paper introduces the Matrix-MCD (M-MCD) estimator, which extends the MCD principle to matrix-variate distributions. The M-MCD objective is to find the data subset of a given size that minimizes the determinant of a structured covariance matrix, assumed to be the Kronecker product of two scatter matrices corresponding to row and column dependencies. We develop a bespoke concentration-step (C-step) algorithm for this non-convex problem and prove its convergence. The resulting estimators are shown to be affine equivariant. We derive the asymptotic breakdown point and influence function, demonstrating high robustness.

The methodology is implemented through an efficient iterative algorithm that alternates between penalized generalized estimating equations for the non-parametric component and a penalized profile likelihood optimization for the parametric components.

First, we employ unsupervised graph representation learning techniques, such as node2vec or Graph Neural Networks, to generate low-dimensional vector embeddings for each unit that capture complex topological features, including local neighborhood structure and global network position. Second, these embeddings are used as covariates in a propensity score model to estimate the probability of treatment assignment conditional on network structure. Stratification on the resulting network-aware propensity scores creates balanced sub-populations where network confounding is mitigated. We demonstrate how direct and indirect (spillover) effects can then be estimated within these strata.

The production rules and their associated probabilities are learned from a manually annotated corpus of Schenkerian graphs. The system operates generatively: starting from the axiomatic Ursatz, it recursively applies production rules to derive a complete, structurally coherent tonal composition. We evaluate the generated outputs using a combination of computational metrics (e.g., tonal tension models, voice-leading parsimony) and formal listening tests.

By operating on a sequence of audio features, such as mel-frequency cepstral coefficients or chroma vectors, the HDP-HMM autonomously infers the multi-layered structure through Bayesian inference. The nonparametric nature of the Dirichlet process allows the model to learn the appropriate complexity (i.e., the number of distinct segments at each hierarchical layer) directly from the data.

"Classical psychoacoustic models of dissonance, based on harmonic beating and critical bandwidths, fail to account for several perceptual phenomena. This paper presents a novel computational model of sensory dissonance grounded in neural synchrony. We utilize a detailed biophysical model of the auditory periphery to simulate the stochastic firing patterns of a population of auditory nerve fibers in response to complex musical intervals. Our central hypothesis is that dissonance is a direct correlate of the temporal asynchrony and irregularity of neural spike trains across the tonotopically organized nerve population.

"This paper introduces a quantitative framework for tracing the evolution of harmonic language using tools from information theory. We analyze a large-scale diachronic corpus of digitized scores spanning the Common Practice Period (c. 1650-1900). Each composition is parsed into a sequence of chord symbols, which are then modeled as a higher-order Markov chain. We compute key information-theoretic metrics for each composer's oeuvre, including the Shannon entropy of the chord distribution (harmonic variety) and the mutual information between adjacent chords (harmonic predictability). By tracking these metrics over historical time, we can objectively measure stylistic trends, such as the gradual increase in harmonic complexity and the decrease in syntactical constraint. Furthermore, we use the concept of Kullback-Leibler divergence to quantify the stylistic 'distance' between composers and to identify specific harmonic innovations that deviate from the established norms of a given period, providing an empirical basis for claims of musical influence and originality.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Quantifying Harmonic Innovation: An Information-Theoretic Approach to Diachronic Stylistic Analysis of the Common Practice Period
"The separation of individual melodic lines in complex polyphonic and contrapuntal music is a formidable challenge for source separation algorithms. This paper reframes the problem within the domain of Graph Signal Processing (GSP). We model the magnitude spectrogram of a musical piece as a weighted undirected graph, where each time-frequency (TF) bin is a node. Edge weights between nodes are defined by a learned affinity metric incorporating principles of auditory scene analysis, such as harmonicity, pitch continuity (common fate), and timbral similarity. The task of segregating musical streams is then formulated as a spectral clustering problem on this TF-adjacency graph. By computing the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian (the graph's 'Fourier basis'), we can embed the TF bins into a space where individual melodic lines are linearly separable. This approach demonstrably outperforms conventional methods like NMF and deep learning-based architectures on challenging fugal and choral repertoires, preserving melodic integrity with fewer artifacts.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Contrapuntal Stream Segregation via Graph Signal Processing on a Time-Frequency Adjacency Graph
"The realization of fault-tolerant topological quantum computation hinges upon the coherent manipulation of non-Abelian anyons, such as Majorana zero modes (MZMs). We propose and theoretically analyze a protocol for high-fidelity braiding of MZMs in a two-dimensional semiconductor-superconductor heterostructure. By applying periodic microwave driving fields, we dynamically induce a transient p+ip superconducting phase, creating and manipulating a sparse array of MZMs without requiring fine-tuned gate voltages or complex T-junction geometries. Our Floquet engineering approach effectively opens a robust topological gap, suppressing quasi-particle poisoning and enhancing coherence. We calculate the non-Abelian Berry phase acquired during a braiding cycle using the Floquet-Magnus expansion and demonstrate that the resulting unitary transformation corresponds to a topologically protected Clifford gate.

We investigate this duality by constructing a novel class of tensor network states, termed Hyperbolic Multiscale Entanglement Renormalization Ansatz (hMERA), that discretizes the spatial slice of an Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. By interpreting the network's logical indices as a boundary conformal field theory (CFT), we demonstrate that the geometric entanglement entropy, calculated via the min-cut max-flow theorem on the tensor network graph, precisely reproduces the Ryu-Takanagi formula. Furthermore, we show that our hMERA construction inherently embeds a quantum error-correcting code, where bulk logical operators are protected from boundary erasures. This provides a concrete toy model for the emergence of a local bulk effective field theory from the non-local entanglement structure of the boundary CFT, solidifying the link between quantum information and gravitational dynamics.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Kuantum,Generated,Holographic Entanglement Entropy and Spacetime Emergence from a Tensor Network Model of Quantum Gravity

Here, we report the experimental observation of a third-order exceptional point (EP3) in a coupled-resonator photonic crystal slab. By engineering spatially tailored gain and loss profiles via optical pumping, we tune the system’s non-Hermitian Hamiltonian to the EP3 degeneracy. Transmission spectroscopy reveals a characteristic E^(1/3) frequency splitting in response to external perturbations, confirming the EP3's topological nature.

Using Floquet theory, we derive an effective time-independent Hamiltonian that exhibits a bulk quadrupolar moment, the hallmark of a second-order topological phase. Our Floquet engineering protocol breaks time-reversal symmetry, resulting in chiral hinge modes that propagate unidirectionally along the system's vertical edges. We characterize the topological phase diagram as a function of driving frequency and amplitude, identifying robust regions supporting these anomalous one-dimensional edge states.

The engine cycle consists of four strokes: two isochoric processes where the qubit interacts with the reservoirs, and two 'iso-coherent' strokes where the qubit's energy gap is modulated while preserving coherence in a specific basis. We demonstrate that the presence of coherence during the iso-coherent strokes allows for positive work extraction, even when the qubit population remains in a thermal Gibbs state with respect to the instantaneous Hamiltonian. The measured work output and efficiency are in excellent agreement with a quantum thermodynamic model based on a collision-based master equation.

Using quantum state tomography on subsystems of varying sizes, we directly measure the time evolution of the second Rényi entropy following a global quench. Our results reveal a clear logarithmic growth of entanglement, a hallmark of MBL, which persists for timescales exceeding the local decoherence time by two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we find evidence for Hilbert space fragmentation, where the system dynamics are confined to disconnected subspaces, signaled by suppressed scrambling of certain initial product states.

Our protocol utilizes path-entangled N00N states in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, where one arm is coupled to the thermal environment. We compute the quantum Fisher information matrix for this open quantum system and show that its determinant scales as N^4, indicating a 1/N^2 advantage in the joint estimation uncertainty over classical strategies. We identify an optimal measurement basis that nearly saturates the quantum Cramér-Rao bound.

In this regime, the system's ground state, or 'dressed vacuum,' is a highly entangled state containing a cloud of virtual photons. We report on the spectroscopic probing of this exotic ground state in a circuit QED architecture comprising three flux qubits galvanically coupled to a superconducting resonator, achieving a normalized coupling ratio g/ω ≈ 1.3. By applying a two-tone spectroscopy technique, we observe parity-forbidden transitions originating directly from the dressed vacuum to the first excited state manifold.

"Chiral quantum optics, where the direction of light propagation is locked to its polarization or pseudo-spin, offers a powerful platform for building non-reciprocal quantum devices. We demonstrate deterministic, non-reciprocal single-photon routing using quantum emitters coupled to a photonic crystal waveguide. The waveguide is engineered to possess a linear dispersion with a transverse spin-momentum lock, meaning left- and right-propagating modes carry opposite circular polarizations. By selectively exciting a coherently-driven quantum dot with circularly polarized light, we achieve directional emission into the waveguide with a measured contrast ratio exceeding 95:5. This directionality is switchable on nanosecond timescales via the optical drive polarization. Conversely, an incoming single photon's absorption by the emitter is strongly dependent on its propagation direction. This work establishes a scalable building block for integrated quantum networks, enabling the creation of single-photon isolators, circulators, and deterministic spin-photon interfaces without magnetic fields.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Kuantum,Generated,Non-Reciprocal Single-Photon Transport Mediated by Spin-Momentum Locked Emitters in a Photonic Crystal Waveguide

Here, we investigate the molecular underpinnings of convergent craniofacial morphologies in multiple lineages of cichlid fishes adapted to similar durophagous niches. Through comparative phylogenomics and ATAC-seq analysis, we identified thousands of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) exhibiting accelerated evolution specifically within the convergent lineages. A significant subset of these parallel-evolving CREs are located near key developmental genes, including bmp4 and sp7, and display concordant signatures of positive selection. Functional validation using CRISPR-dCas9 epigenome editing in a model species demonstrates that sequence variation within these convergent CREs directly modulates gene expression, altering pharyngeal jaw morphology. Our findings reveal that convergent phenotypic evolution is predominantly driven by parallel, independent mutations within a constrained set of non-coding regulatory loci, highlighting the deterministic role of pre-existing gene regulatory network architecture in shaping adaptive trajectories.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Genomic Signatures of Convergent Trophic Specialization Driven by Parallel Shifts in Cis-Regulatory Architecture

Whole-genome, time-series sequencing revealed recurrent selective sweeps targeting phage receptor-binding proteins and bacterial outer membrane proteins, consistent with an evolutionary arms race. Critically, we observed a pattern of 'genomic escalation,' where both partners evolved increasingly complex defense and counter-defense mechanisms, including the horizontal acquisition and modification of CRISPR-Cas systems in the host and the evolution of anti-CRISPR proteins in the phage.

Parental exposure induced the production of specific 24-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that guide de novo DNA methylation in the CG, CHG, and CHH contexts at hundreds of stress-responsive loci, including key transcription factors and metabolic genes. These epialleles, and the associated stress-tolerant phenotype, were heritably transmitted for at least three generations in the absence of the initial stressor, mediated by a self-reinforcing RNA-directed DNA Methylation (RdDM) loop. Progeny of stressed plants exhibited significantly higher survival rates under subsequent osmotic challenge.

We generated stage-specific transcriptomes across the development of 25 arthropod species, spanning chelicerates, myriapods, crustaceans, and hexapods. By integrating these data into a phylogenetic framework, we computationally reconstructed the ancestral GRN for appendage patterning. Our analysis confirms the deep homology of a core set of transcription factors, including Distal-less (Dll) and dachshund (dac), which retain conserved upstream regulation. However, the downstream target genes of this conserved kernel have diverged extensively among lineages, a phenomenon known as developmental systems drift. This network rewiring correlates directly with major morphological transitions, such as the evolution of uniramous versus biramous limbs and the specialization of mouthparts. These findings demonstrate that morphological diversification is driven less by the evolution of new patterning genes and more by changes in the connectivity of ancient, conserved regulatory modules.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Phylo-transcriptomic Reconstruction of Arthropod Appendage Gene Regulatory Networks Reveals Deep Homology and Developmental Systems Drift

Phylogenetic analysis confirms this haplotype introgressed from Denisovans, an archaic hominin sister group to Neanderthals, into modern humans approximately 40,000 years ago. The introgressed allele is found at nearly 90% frequency in Tibetan populations but is virtually absent from adjacent low-altitude populations, and it exhibits an extended block of linkage disequilibrium, a classic signature of a recent, strong positive selective sweep. This represents a clear case where a pre-adapted allele from an extinct, high-altitude-adapted population enabled rapid, profound physiological adaptation in colonizing modern humans, underscoring the creative role of admixture in evolution.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Genomic Evidence of Adaptive Introgression from an Archaic Hominin Lineage Facilitating High-Altitude Adaptation

The molecular chaperone Hsp90 is a key agent of canalization, stabilizing metastable protein clients. We tested the hypothesis that Hsp90 acts as an 'evolutionary capacitor' by transiently inhibiting its function in multiple isogenic lines of Drosophila melanogaster under novel thermal stress. This decanalization treatment unveiled a wide spectrum of previously cryptic, heritable morphological phenotypes affecting bristle number, wing venation, and eye structure. The specific phenotypes revealed were dependent on the underlying genetic background of the line. Subsequent selection on these novel traits in the absence of Hsp90 inhibition led to their genetic assimilation within a few generations. Our results demonstrate that environmental stress can compromise cellular buffering systems, releasing stores of cryptic genetic variation that can fuel rapid and substantial evolutionary change.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Decanalization by Environmental Stress: Hsp90 as an Evolutionary Capacitor Releasing Cryptic Genetic Variation
"The evolution of eusociality, characterized by reproductive division of labor, represents a major evolutionary transition where the colony becomes the primary unit of selection. This transition requires the suppression of individual-level conflict. We developed a theoretical model predicting that colony-level selection should favor host mechanisms that silence selfish genetic elements (SGEs), whose proliferation is detrimental to colony fitness. We tested this prediction with a comparative genomic analysis across 50 species of Hymenoptera with varying levels of sociality. Our findings show a strong negative correlation between the degree of eusociality and the genomic load of active retrotransposons and segregation distorters. Lineages exhibiting advanced eusociality, such as leaf-cutter ants, possess significantly expanded and more potent RNA interference (RNAi) pathways.

Traditional phylogenetic comparative methods are often hampered by incomplete taxon sampling and biases in the fossil record. We introduce a new Bayesian state-dependent speciation and extinction (SSE) model, BiSSE-Fossil, that explicitly incorporates stratigraphic data from fossils to jointly infer trait evolution and diversification rates. Applying this model to the early gnathostome phylogeny, we demonstrate that the evolution of the jaw was a pivotal event that irreversibly increased the rate of speciation (λ) by an order of magnitude while simultaneously decreasing the background extinction rate (μ). This shift created a new adaptive zone, precipitating the explosive radiation of jawed vertebrates.

We investigated the genomic basis of freshwater adaptation in multiple, independent populations of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) using a combination of pooled whole-genome sequencing (Pool-Seq) and quantitative trait mapping. In contrast to the classic model of hard selective sweeps on a few major-effect loci, our analysis revealed a highly polygenic architecture. We identified over 1,500 small-effect loci where allele frequencies were consistently differentiated between marine and freshwater ecotypes. These loci are enriched in genes associated with ion transport, kidney function, and metabolic regulation. A polygenic score constructed from these loci accurately predicts the salinity tolerance phenotype of individuals. These results demonstrate that rapid adaptation can proceed via a 'soft sweep' mechanism acting on standing genetic variation, leading to a diffuse, genome-wide signature of selection that reshapes complex physiological traits.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,The Diffuse Genomic Architecture of Polygenic Adaptation to Salinity in Threespine Stickleback

Bayesian demographic modeling and admixture graph analyses reveal a complex demographic history far exceeding simple models of climate-driven decline. We identified at least three distinct metapopulations—Beringian, West Eurasian, and a cryptic Siberian lineage—that experienced asynchronous population expansions and contractions linked to Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles. During periods of climatic amelioration and range expansion, these metapopulations admixed, but they became severely fragmented during the Last Glacial Maximum.

The first stage employs a sparse regularization technique to select a subset of potentially valid instruments, while the second stage utilizes a Neyman-orthogonal moment function to construct an estimator for the causal effect that is insensitive to first-stage estimation errors. This debiasing step ensures that our estimator is asymptotically normal and permits valid statistical inference. We establish theoretical results demonstrating that our method provides consistent estimation and valid confidence intervals even when a significant fraction of the instruments violate the exclusion restriction, provided a plurality rule holds.

This technique bypasses the need to characterize complex polyhedral selection regions, which is a major limitation of existing selective inference methods. We prove that our proposed test achieves exact Type I error control in finite samples for Gaussian covariates and asymptotically correct coverage under broader distributional assumptions for the canonical GLM family.

Our analysis reveals that cone tilt fundamentally alters the manifestation of the chiral anomaly, inducing a non-trivial planar Hall effect even in the absence of orbital magnetoresistance. This effect arises from the chiral-anomaly-induced charge pumping between Weyl nodes, which projects differently onto the electric field and current directions due to the tilted geometry. We provide analytical expressions for the planar Hall conductivity as a function of magnetic field strength, tilt parameter, and internode scattering rate, proposing a distinct experimental signature to disentangle topological contributions from classical transport artifacts.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Fizik,Generated,Chiral Anomaly and Planar Hall Effect in a Disordered Weyl Semimetal with Tilted Cones
"We investigate the imprint of primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) from inflationary models featuring a temporary violation of rotational invariance. Such anisotropies, potentially sourced by a background vector field, generate a statistically anisotropic stochastic gravitational-wave background. We compute the full angular power spectrum of the CMB temperature and polarization anisotropies, including the B-modes, which are a primary target for next-generation observatories. Our analysis demonstrates that statistical anisotropy introduces non-zero TB and EB correlations and modifies the BB power spectrum with a characteristic quadrupolar (and higher multipole) angular dependence. We formulate a set of unique observables beyond the standard tensor-to-scalar ratio, r, that can be used to distinguish these models from standard isotropic inflation. These signatures provide a novel observational window to probe the fundamental symmetries of the universe during its earliest moments.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Fizik,Generated,Primordial Gravitational Wave Signatures in the CMB from Anisotropic Inflationary Models
"Standard fluctuation theorems, such as the Jarzynski equality, are foundational to non-equilibrium statistical mechanics but rely on assumptions of classical dynamics or weak system-bath coupling. We derive an exact quantum work fluctuation theorem applicable to systems arbitrarily strongly coupled to a non-Markovian thermal reservoir. Using a Feynman-Vernon path integral approach, we define quantum work as a two-time measurement protocol on the composite system-plus-bath entity. The resulting expression for the characteristic function of work explicitly incorporates the role of initial system-bath correlations and the non-local temporal memory of the reservoir. Our formulation demonstrates that strong coupling introduces significant non-Gaussian corrections to the work distribution.

By solving the full hydrodynamics equations for an active system, derived from a generalized Toner-Tu model with nematic order, we explore the interplay between active stress, elastic forces, and viscous dissipation. Our simulations reveal that the system self-organizes into a chaotic state characterized by the spontaneous proliferation of ±1/2 disclination pairs. We analyze the defect kinetics, finding that the annihilation rate deviates significantly from the diffusive scaling observed in passive liquid crystals, a direct consequence of the self-propulsion of defects driven by active flows. The spatial correlation function of defect density exhibits a power-law behavior, suggesting a critical-like state governed by non-equilibrium dynamics.

The simulations solve the full Einstein field equations using the moving-puncture formalism with adaptive mesh refinement. We extract the gravitational waveforms and analyze their distinct morphological features compared to quasi-circular, non-precessing inspirals. Eccentricity introduces periodic amplitude and frequency modulations, while precession generates complex modulations dependent on the orbital and Lense-Thirring frequencies. We demonstrate that the interplay between these two effects breaks key parameter degeneracies in gravitational wave data analysis, particularly between mass ratio and spin components. Furthermore, the quasi-normal mode spectrum of the remnant Kerr black hole is excited differently by eccentric mergers, providing a powerful null test of the no-hair theorem in the strong-field regime for next-generation detectors.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Fizik,Generated,"Gravitational Wave Signatures of Eccentric, Precessing Binary Black Hole Mergers in Numerical Relativity"

By performing large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the extended Bose-Hubbard model, which includes both contact and long-range dipole-dipole interactions, we map out the system's quantum phase diagram. For strong dipolar interactions, the roton mode in the excitation spectrum softens, signaling a transition from a coherent superfluid to a state with spontaneous density modulation. We demonstrate that the resulting phase simultaneously exhibits the crystalline order of a solid, evidenced by a non-zero structure factor at a finite wavevector, and the off-diagonal long-range order of a superfluid, characterized by a finite condensate fraction. The anisotropic confinement is crucial for stabilizing this delicate quantum phase against collapse, offering a viable route for its experimental realization.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Fizik,Generated,Supersolid Phase Formation in a Dipolar Bose Gas with Anisotropic Confinement

Our approach, utilizing the Caldeira-Leggett model for dissipation, quantifies the quantum back-action of the measurement apparatus and the entanglement between photonic and phononic modes. We derive the complete power spectrum of the cavity output, showing that finite temperature effects and non-zero wall conductivity not only contribute to the noise floor but also modify the axion conversion signal line shape, inducing a measurable asymmetry. This rigorous treatment provides a more accurate projection of the signal-to-noise ratio for next-generation axion dark matter experiments, such as ADMX, and is essential for optimizing search strategies in the quantum-limited, high-frequency regime.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Fizik,Generated,Axion Electrodynamics in a Dissipative Cavity and the Search for High-Frequency Dark Matter

The application of a triaxial strain pattern creates a synthetic pseudo-magnetic field with zero spatial average but large local fluctuations, leading to the formation of pseudo-Landau levels. In the presence of a real, uniform perpendicular magnetic field, the interplay between the real and pseudo-fields dramatically reconstructs the electronic spectrum. By performing exact diagonalization on a torus geometry, we demonstrate that for specific strain amplitudes and filling factors within the N=0 Landau level, the ground state of the interacting system becomes a non-Abelian Moore-Read Pfaffian state. We calculate the quasiparticle excitation gap and the topological entanglement entropy, providing robust evidence for this exotic fractional quantum Hall phase, which could be realized and probed via scanning tunneling microscopy.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Fizik,Generated,Fractional Landau Levels and Non-Abelian Excitations in Graphene under Strain Engineering

Traditional approaches to computational Schenkerian analysis rely on symbolic inputs (e.g., MIDI, MusicXML), creating a significant gap between theoretical modeling and acoustical reality. Our proposed framework bridges this divide by integrating a Constant-Q Transform (CQT) frontend with a hybrid Convolutional-Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN). The convolutional layers are trained to extract salient polyphonic features and identify harmonically stable tones, while a subsequent Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network models the temporal dependencies inherent in voice-leading and structural prolongation. By training the model on a curated dataset of expert-annotated recordings, we demonstrate its capacity to identify foreground melodic elaborations and infer middleground linear progressions with high accuracy.

This study investigates the interplay between harmonic transformation and timbral evolution in ambient electronic music. We construct a dual feature space wherein harmonic progressions are represented as paths on the Tonnetz, while simultaneous timbral shifts are mapped as trajectories based on their spectral centroid and flux. Using a corpus of works by seminal artists in the genre, we apply canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to uncover latent relationships between specific neo-Riemannian operators (P, L, R) and quantifiable changes in timbral brightness and texture. Our results reveal statistically significant correlations, suggesting that composers intuitively pair parsimonious harmonic shifts with gradual timbral modulations.

This paper proposes a computational model to predict the perceived intensity of metrical dissonance directly from an audio signal. We first extract a multi-dimensional feature set from audio, including onset detection functions, spectral flux, and autocorrelation-derived tempo estimates, designed to capture rhythmic pulse and subdivision layers. A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is then employed to cluster these features into states corresponding to different levels of metrical stability. Subsequently, a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model is trained on listener ratings of perceived tension from a controlled stimulus set. The model demonstrates high predictive accuracy, outperforming simpler metrics based solely on beat-level deviation. The findings provide empirical validation for theoretical concepts of rhythmic tension and offer a robust tool for analyzing rhythmic structure in performance and for applications in generative music systems.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Modeling Perceptual Correlates of Metrical Dissonance using Gaussian Mixture Models and Supervised Learning
"The automated analysis of contrapuntal music is critically dependent on accurate voice separation from a polyphonic mixture.

We incorporate harmonic constraints into the NMF decomposition by initializing the spectral basis vectors with templates derived from period-appropriate instrumental timbres and penalizing spectrally non-harmonic activations. This 'harmonically-aware' NMF significantly improves voice-leading integrity compared to standard NMF variants. In a second stage, the separated voices, represented as piano-roll matrices, are subjected to a dynamic time warping (DTW) based algorithm to automatically detect canonic imitation, inversion, and stretto.

The β-VAE learns a compressed, disentangled latent representation of complex timbral and harmonic structures. By performing structured interpolations and arithmetic operations within this learned latent space, we can generate novel sound spectra that exhibit coherent yet original characteristics. The disentanglement property of the β-parameter allows for more intuitive control over generative features, separating timbral qualities from harmonic density. Subjective listening tests confirm that the generated audio is perceived as possessing high structural integrity and aesthetic novelty. This methodology provides a powerful tool for composers, enabling the exploration of complex sound worlds that bridge the gap between existing spectral works through semantically meaningful latent space navigation.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Latent Space Interpolation for Microtonal Spectral Composition using a Beta-Variational Autoencoder

The methodology first computes a chromagram-based self-similarity matrix (SSM) from the audio. A novel checkerboard kernel is applied to the SSM to detect structural boundaries, facilitating robust temporal segmentation. Each resulting segment is then converted into a normalized chroma vector, which serves as input to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained to classify the segment's predominant PC set, outputting its Forte number. We evaluate the system on a newly created, ground-truth dataset of annotated recordings from the Second Viennese School.

We utilize a high-resolution pitch extraction algorithm based on the YIN estimator, followed by a robust sinusoidal model to decouple the vibrato component from the underlying pitch contour. We then extract key parameters: vibrato rate, extent, and portamento duration and slope. Applying this methodology to a corpus of recordings by violinists from the Auer and Franco-Belgian schools (c. 1910-1940), we employ statistical analysis to identify significant differences between the pedagogical lineages.

Concurrently, we extract audio features from the corresponding orchestral recordings, including a continuous tempo curve, RMS energy for dynamics, and spectral information for articulation. A dual-stream neural network, comprising a temporal convolutional network (TCN) for gesture and a CRNN for audio, learns modality-specific representations. A cross-modal attention mechanism is then employed to identify salient gestural features that maximally correlate with specific sonic outcomes.

"Transformational theory, particularly its neo-Riemannian instantiation, has offered profound insights into harmonic structures by modeling relationships as operations within a mathematical group. This paper proposes a generalization of this approach beyond the domain of pitch. We construct analogous transformational networks for rhythm and timbre. For rhythm, a 'metrical state space' is defined using beat-synchronous onset probability vectors, with transformations representing operations like metric shift and subdivision layering. For timbre, we use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) to create a reduced-dimensionality timbre space, where transformations represent timbral brightening or textural changes. By formalizing these non-pitch parameters within a unified group-theoretic framework, we demonstrate the analytical power of tracking musical development as a trajectory through these multiple, interacting geometric spaces.

Moving beyond simple N-gram models, our hierarchical Bayesian framework computes the probability of a musical event conditioned on three interacting factors: voice-leading parsimony (a likelihood term favoring minimal pitch motion), learned tonal schemata (a prior distribution over common chord progressions derived from corpus analysis), and metrical context (which weights expectations based on an event's position within the metrical grid). The model dynamically updates its predictions, generating a continuous stream of information content (surprisal) values for a given musical surface. We validate the model by demonstrating a high correlation between its output surprisal and empirical data from cognitive experiments, including reaction times and ERP components like the ERAN.

This RNA-free system directly recognizes target mtDNA sequences and induces C•G-to-T•A transitions with high specificity. We systematically optimized the linker regions and deaminase variants to achieve efficiencies up to 47% at the ND4 locus in human HEK293T cells. Whole-mitochondrial genome sequencing revealed minimal off-target editing, an order of magnitude lower than nuclear-targeted CRISPR base editors.

Utilizing a combination of Chromatin Isolation by RNA Purification (ChIRP-seq) and Hi-C analysis, we systematically mapped the genome-wide interactions of the lncRNA FIRRE. Our data reveal that FIRRE establishes a trans-chromosomal interaction hub, binding to specific loci on multiple chromosomes that are enriched for the architectural protein CTCF. Depletion of FIRRE via antisense oligonucleotides results in a significant disruption of these long-range interactions and a concomitant alteration of topologically associating domain (TAD) boundaries near its binding sites. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a conserved tandem repeat element within FIRRE is essential for its interaction with the nuclear matrix protein hnRNPU, which facilitates its architectural function.

To deconstruct this complexity, we performed simultaneous single-cell transcriptomic (scRNA-seq) and chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) profiling on over 25,000 cells from patient-derived xenograft models. Our integrative analysis identified four distinct cellular states, including a rare, slow-cycling population characterized by a unique epigenetic landscape and a transcriptomic signature enriched for SOX2, POU3F2, and genes associated with developmental neural stem cells. This quiescent stem-like (QSL) population exhibited high expression of ABC transporters and DNA repair enzymes, consistent with a pre-existing chemoresistant phenotype.

"Quality control during protein synthesis is essential for cellular homeostasis. Ribosome stalling on problematic mRNA sequences provides a critical window for nascent polypeptide chain folding and inspection. We used cryo-electron microscopy to determine the structure of a eukaryotic 80S ribosome stalled at a polyproline motif, captured at 2.8 Å resolution. The structure reveals that the nascent polypeptide chain adopts a specific helical conformation within the ribosomal exit tunnel, which makes direct contact with ribosomal RNA elements of the peptidyl transferase center (PTC). This interaction induces an allosteric conformational change in the PTC, uncoupling A-site tRNA accommodation from peptide bond formation and thereby halting translation elongation. We further show that the ribosome-associated quality control factor Rqc2 specifically recognizes this stalled conformation.

Using in vitro reconstitution assays with purified FUS, NMR spectroscopy, and super-resolution microscopy in living cells, we dissected the molecular grammar governing FUS-driven LLPS. We demonstrate that the phase separation of FUS is primarily mediated by its low-complexity domain (LCD) through a network of multivalent cation-π interactions between arginine and tyrosine residues. Isotopic labeling and NMR experiments confirm these specific contacts, while mutagenesis studies show that substituting either arginine or tyrosine residues dramatically elevates the saturation concentration required for LLPS. Importantly, ALS-associated mutations in the FUS LCD disrupt these critical interactions, leading to the formation of irreversible, solid-like amyloid aggregates instead of dynamic liquid droplets, providing a direct molecular link between aberrant phase transition and neurodegeneration.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation of FUS drives Stress Granule Assembly through Multivalent Arginine-Tyrosine Interactions
"The RAG1/RAG2 recombinase initiates V(D)J recombination to generate antigen receptor diversity, but its off-target activity can lead to oncogenic genomic rearrangements. Current methods lack the sensitivity to map off-target RAG cleavage events genome-wide.

Our analysis uncovered thousands of previously unannotated off-target sites, which preferentially occurred within active enhancers and super-enhancers marked by H3K27ac. These cryptic sites often possess degenerate recombination signal sequences (RSSs) but are rendered accessible by the local chromatin environment. Importantly, a meta-analysis of genomic data from T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients revealed a significant overlap between these off-target sites and the breakpoints of oncogenic translocations involving proto-oncogenes like LMO2 and TAL1.

"The circadian clock relies on a transcriptional-translational feedback loop whose timing is precisely regulated by post-translational modifications (PTMs) of core clock proteins. To comprehensively map this regulatory layer, we performed time-resolved, quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of the murine suprachiasmatic nucleus. Our data revealed a complex temporal network of phosphorylation events, leading us to uncover a previously unknown PTM crosstalk on the PERIOD2 (PER2) protein. We demonstrate that phosphorylation of PER2 at serine 662 by Casein Kinase 1δ (CK1δ) creates a binding motif for the E3 ubiquitin ligase β-TrCP, targeting PER2 for proteasomal degradation. However, we identified a competing SUMOylation event at the adjacent lysine 665, which sterically hinders β-TrCP binding and stabilizes PER2. Genetic or chemical inhibition of the SUMO E2 ligase UBE2I accelerates PER2 degradation and significantly shortens the circadian period in both cell culture and live animals.

This campaign identified a novel chemical scaffold that acts as a potent and selective negative allosteric modulator (NAM). The lead compound, ZK-7b, inhibited G-protein activation with nanomolar potency but did not displace orthosteric radioligands. A 3.1 Å cryo-electron microscopy structure of the A2AAR-Gs complex bound to ZK-7b and an agonist revealed that the NAM binds to a previously uncharacterized cryptic pocket on the intracellular face of the receptor, involving transmembrane helices 2 and 4. Molecular dynamics simulations show that ZK-7b stabilizes an inactive conformation of the Gα-interacting intracellular loop 2, thereby uncoupling the receptor from its cognate G-protein.

"Metastasis is a complex process involving intricate communication between tumor cells and distant microenvironments.

Through in vivo lineage tracing, we show these exosomes are preferentially taken up by hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in the liver. Upon uptake, miR-200c directly targets and represses transcription of SEC23A, a key component of the COPII vesicle transport system. SEC23A downregulation impairs collagen secretion from HSCs, leading to a profound remodeling of the liver extracellular matrix.

Our analysis suggests that the connectivity of spacetime is not a fundamental property but rather an emergent feature derived from the underlying entanglement architecture of the quantum state.

By solving the exact non-Markovian master equation beyond the rotating-wave and Born approximations using a time-convolutionless projection operator technique, we demonstrate that the decay of quantum discord is non-monotonic. Our results show distinct periods of recurrence, where quantum correlations are partially restored after an initial decay phase, a phenomenon absent in Markovian descriptions. This revival is directly linked to the backflow of information from the environment to the system, quantified by the non-Markovianity measure. For certain reservoir spectral densities, we observe a transient amplification of discord above its initial value. These findings challenge the conventional view of irreversible information loss and have significant implications for preserving quantum resources in realistic noisy quantum processors and communication channels.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Kuantum,Generated,Recurrence and Amplification of Quantum Discord in a Non-Markovian Qubit-Reservoir System

By calculating the three-tangle and the Peres-Horodecki criterion for the resulting mixed state shared by the observers, we quantify the degradation of entanglement as a function of their proper acceleration. Our results show that while genuine tripartite entanglement is fragile and vanishes at a finite acceleration, bipartite correlations between pairs of observers persist.

We then analyze an initially maximally entangled Bell state of two field modes. For Rob, the Unruh effect traces out the inaccessible modes behind his event horizon, resulting in a mixed density matrix for the shared state. We compute the concurrence and logarithmic negativity of this state, showing that entanglement vanishes in the limit of infinite acceleration.

"This paper presents a novel approach for analyzing expressive performance by modeling deviations from a nominal score. We employ a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture where the generator learns to transform a 'platonic', mechanically rendered version of a score into a plausible, expressive performance by manipulating micro-timing, dynamics, and articulation. The discriminator is trained to distinguish between these generated performances and recordings by human artists. Once trained, the generator's latent space forms a low-dimensional manifold representing a specific performance style. By projecting real performances onto this manifold, we can quantitatively characterize and compare them. We analyze a large dataset of Chopin mazurka performances, revealing distinct stylistic clusters corresponding to different pianists and historical periods. This methodology moves beyond simple statistical descriptions of expressive parameters, offering a powerful generative model of performance style that captures complex interdependencies between expressive dimensions.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Quantifying Expressive Performance Deviations as a Stylistic Manifold Using Generative Adversarial Networks
"The role of non-genetic inheritance in speciation remains a contentious frontier in evolutionary biology. Here, we investigate the contribution of transgenerational epigenetic variation to the establishment of reproductive isolation. Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and behavioral assays in a sympatric species pair of cichlid fish, we identify hundreds of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with divergent mate preferences. Crucially, a subset of these epialleles, particularly those within CpG islands upstream of neurodevelopmental genes, are stably transmitted for at least three generations in the absence of continued environmental cues. Our cross-fostering experiments demonstrate that inherited methylation patterns, not learned behaviors, are the primary determinants of assortative mating. These findings provide compelling evidence that heritable epigenetic modifications can generate rapid and persistent behavioral isolation, thereby facilitating sympatric speciation by creating a 'soft' inheritance substrate upon which selection can act before the fixation of genetic differences.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Transgenerational Epigenetic Inheritance as a Driver of Incipient Sympatric Speciation
"The co-evolutionary arms race between bacteria and their bacteriophage predators is a major driver of microbial diversity. While the adaptive dynamics of CRISPR-Cas immune systems are well-documented, the counter-adaptations in phages remain less understood. We conducted a large-scale comparative phylogenomic analysis of over 2,000 temperate phage genomes, focusing on the evolution of anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins. Our results reveal that Acr loci exhibit extreme evolutionary lability and are overwhelmingly concentrated in genomic hotspots flanked by mobile genetic elements. We reconstructed numerous instances of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of Acr cassettes between distantly related prophages, often resulting in the acquisition of a pre-adapted defense against the host's specific CRISPR-Cas subtype. These findings indicate that HGT, rather than de novo mutation, is the principal engine of Acr evolution, allowing phages to rapidly acquire novel immunomodulatory functions and fueling the perpetual Red Queen dynamics of host-parasite interactions.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Accelerated Evolution of Anti-CRISPR Loci via Horizontal Gene Transfer in Prophage Genomes

We employ a phylogenomic approach, analyzing a dataset of 1,150 ultraconserved element (UCE) loci from 125 taxa representing all major metazoan phyla. Critically, we move beyond simple data concatenation by utilizing coalescent-based species tree methods (e.g., ASTRAL-III) that explicitly model incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), a major source of discordance in rapid, ancient radiations. Our results robustly support the monophyly of Porifera as the sister group to all other Metazoa and resolve the contentious placement of Ctenophora. By quantifying discordance across nodes, we demonstrate that ILS, rather than introgression, is the dominant confounding factor at the base of the animal tree.

"The antagonistic pleiotropy (AP) hypothesis posits that senescence evolves because alleles beneficial in early life have deleterious effects later. Direct empirical evidence for this trade-off at the molecular level is scarce. We performed a longitudinal RNA-seq analysis on blood cells from a known-age cohort of a long-lived seabird, the wandering albatross (*Diomedea exulans*), spanning ages 5 to 45 years. By modeling gene expression trajectories, we identified a suite of genes whose expression patterns conform to the AP model. Specifically, genes involved in immune response and cellular proliferation showed high expression and positive selection signatures in young, reproductively active birds but were associated with pro-inflammatory pathways and reduced cellular maintenance (e.g., DNA repair, autophagy) in older individuals. These findings provide a transcriptomic-level validation of the AP hypothesis, demonstrating how life-history trade-offs are mechanistically arbitrated at the level of gene regulation.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Genomic Signatures of Antagonistic Pleiotropy: Longitudinal Transcriptomics Reveals Age-Dependent Trade-offs

We investigated this phenomenon in the Neotropical cichlid subfamily Cichlinae, testing the hypothesis that the evolution of a functionally decoupled pharyngeal jaw apparatus catalyzed their explosive radiation. Using high-resolution 3D geometric morphometrics on craniofacial and pharyngeal skeletal elements combined with phylogenetic comparative methods, we demonstrate a significant shift in the rate of morphological evolution coinciding with the origin of this trait. This innovation facilitated a dramatic expansion of trophic morphospace, allowing descendant lineages to partition resources and occupy previously inaccessible ecological niches. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between pharyngeal jaw disparity and species richness across clades, providing robust evidence that this key innovation was a primary catalyst for one of the most spectacular vertebrate adaptive radiations.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Eco-Morphological Divergence and Niche Partitioning Following a Key Innovation in Neotropical Cichlids
"Convergent evolution, the independent origin of similar traits, provides powerful evidence for adaptation. While echolocation in bats and toothed whales is a classic example, its molecular underpinnings are thought to be restricted to a few key genes. We challenged this view by conducting a comprehensive phylogenetically controlled analysis of 2,326 orthologous genes associated with hearing and vision across 24 mammal species. Our screen for parallel amino acid substitutions revealed a statistically significant excess of convergence in dozens of genes within the auditory pathways of echolocating taxa, extending far beyond the well-documented *Prestin* and *TMC1*. These convergent substitutions were enriched in functional domains related to cochlear amplification and neural signal processing. Conversely, we identified parallel signatures of relaxed selection and pseudogenization in visual opsin genes.

Using pooled whole-genome sequencing (Pool-Seq) from populations spanning a 2,000 km latitudinal cline in Australia, we demonstrate a steep cline in inversion frequency, strongly correlated with temperature and aridity gradients. Haplotype analysis revealed that the inverted arrangement carries a distinct suite of alleles in genes associated with stress resistance, metabolic rate, and developmental timing. Experimental evolution under simulated climatic conditions confirmed that the inversion increased in frequency significantly faster than unlinked SNPs with similar clinal patterns.

"The transition from unicellularity to obligate multicellularity represents a major transition in individuality, requiring the suppression of lower-level selection in favor of higher-level fitness. We developed a stochastic individual-based model to investigate the evolutionary dynamics that stabilize nascent multicellular collectives against internal conflict from 'cheater' cells that revert to selfish proliferation. Our simulations demonstrate that while clonal bottlenecking at reproduction is necessary, it is not sufficient to guarantee long-term stability. The critical evolutionary step is the evolution of a regulatory mechanism that enforces germ-soma differentiation, effectively sequestering the reproductive lineage and committing somatic cells to cooperative functions. Multilevel selection analysis shows that collectives with early and irreversible germ-soma specialization have significantly higher group-level fitness and can outcompete collectives prone to somatic cheaters.

"The extinction of Pleistocene megafauna is attributed to a combination of climate change and anthropogenic pressure, but the detailed population dynamics leading to their demise remain unclear. We performed shotgun sequencing on 25 ancient DNA samples from woolly mammoths (*Mammuthus primigenius*) spanning the last 50,000 years. Our analyses reveal a complex demographic history characterized by a significant admixture event with the more southerly Columbian mammoth (*Mammuthus columbi*) around 45,000 years BP, likely driven by climate-induced range shifts. Following this introgression, we used pairwise sequentially Markovian coalescent (PSMC) modeling to reconstruct a dramatic and rapid decline in effective population size (Ne) starting ~15,000 years BP, which predates the final extinction on mainland Eurasia.

We tested this long-standing hypothesis in a population of European starlings (*Sturnus vulgaris*), a species where male song complexity is a primary target of female choice. Using restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq), we correlated individual song repertoire size with genome-wide heterozygosity, a proxy for genetic diversity and fitness. We found a strong, positive relationship between song complexity and heterozygosity. Furthermore, deep sequencing of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II loci revealed that males with more complex songs possessed a greater diversity of MHC alleles and carried a significantly lower endoparasite load. These results provide robust empirical support for the genic capture model, demonstrating that an elaborate sexual signal integrates information across numerous loci, thereby honestly advertising the genetic health and immunocompetence of the signaler.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Genic Capture in Action: Ornament Complexity Covaries with Genome-Wide Heterozygosity and Parasite Resistance

We demonstrate that the radial dimension of the emergent Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space is intrinsically linked to the renormalization group flow of entanglement in the boundary theory. By analyzing the geodesic distances between boundary regions, we reproduce the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for entanglement entropy as a direct consequence of the network's connectivity.

Employing full numerical relativity simulations, we demonstrate that this coupling allows the scalar field's equation of state parameter, w(z), to evolve from w > -1 in the post-recombination era to w < -1 (the phantom divide) at low redshifts. This late-time phantom epoch provides additional acceleration, increasing the locally measured H₀ value without altering the sound horizon scale derived from CMB anisotropies.

Using a generalized Langevin equation formalism incorporating a memory kernel, we analytically demonstrate that the traditional FDT is violated. The magnitude of this violation is shown to be directly proportional to the rate of entropy production and the information-theoretic path entropy associated with the non-conservative work performed on the system. Our results, corroborated by extensive stochastic simulations, establish a quantitative link between the breakdown of time-reversal symmetry at the microscopic level and the macroscopic thermodynamic dissipation, thereby providing a more fundamental framework for understanding the energetics and response functions of systems operating far from thermal equilibrium.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Fizik,Generated,Generalized Fluctuation-Dissipation Relations in Driven Systems with Memory

The periodic drive breaks time-reversal symmetry and modifies the bulk band structure, creating a non-trivial topology characterized by a dynamic second Chern number. This engineered bulk topology gives rise to protected, one-dimensional chiral hinge modes that propagate along the edges of the crystal, a phenomenon absent in the static system. We compute the quasi-energy spectrum and the local density of states to confirm the existence and chirality of these modes.

We show this avoids the cloning paradox by violating assumptions of effective field theory behind the firewall argument. Our model, based on quantum extremal surface computations, naturally reproduces the Page curve for the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation, ensuring unitarity of the evaporation process.

Controllable disorder is introduced through a quasi-periodic potential landscape, tuning the strength of off-diagonal interactions. Following a quantum quench from an initial charge-density-wave state, we monitor the subsequent dynamics by measuring the system's population imbalance and bipartite entanglement entropy. We observe a distinct transition from ergodic behavior, characterized by rapid thermalization and volume-law entanglement growth, to an MBL phase where an initial state imbalance persists indefinitely and entanglement grows logarithmically.

Our simulations show that the reconnection layer fragments due to the plasmoid instability, developing a turbulent state characterized by a cascade of merging magnetic islands and flux ropes. This environment generates a spectrum of kinetic Alfvén waves. We demonstrate that electrons are efficiently accelerated to relativistic energies not primarily within the reconnection exhausts, but via a stochastic second-order Fermi process as they scatter off the contracting and merging magnetic structures.

By introducing a directed asymmetry into the network's adjacency matrix, we break the underlying rotational symmetry of the coupling kernel, a feature common in biological neural networks. Numerical simulations reveal that this asymmetry destabilizes stationary chimera states, leading to the spontaneous formation of coherent and incoherent domains organized into a rigid spiral pattern that rotates at a constant angular velocity.

The scheme utilizes an ensemble of cold atoms trapped within a high-finesse optical cavity, where strong, long-range interactions are mediated by laser-induced transitions to Rydberg states. The Rydberg blockade mechanism allows the creation of a single collective 'superatom' excitation, which can be deterministically mapped onto a single photon state leaving the cavity. By sequentially addressing individually controlled atomic sub-ensembles and applying a series of microwave pulses to manipulate the ground-state manifold, we can controllably entangle photons emitted at different times. We model the protocol's fidelity, accounting for decoherence from atomic motion and spontaneous emission, and show that graph states exceeding fifty nodes can be generated with fidelities sufficient for demonstrating quantum computational advantage in specific sampling problems.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Fizik,Generated,Deterministic Generation of Multi-Photon Graph States using Rydberg-Blockaded Atomic Ensembles
"We explore a class of Supersymmetric (SUSY) Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) based on the SU(5) gauge group where the condition of gaugino mass universality at the GUT scale is relaxed. This non-universality can arise naturally from the non-singlet F-term vacuum expectation values of the chiral superfield responsible for SUSY breaking. We perform a two-loop renormalization group equation (RGE) analysis to evolve the gaugino and scalar mass parameters from the GUT scale to the electroweak scale. The resulting sparticle spectrum exhibits unique phenomenological features, such as a compressed electroweakino sector or a light gluino coexisting with heavy squarks. We analyze the collider signatures of these scenarios at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), focusing on final states with multiple leptons, jets, and significant missing transverse energy. Our analysis demonstrates that current and future LHC searches can probe large regions of the parameter space, potentially distinguishing non-universal models from the more constrained CMSSM.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Fizik,Generated,Supersymmetric Grand Unification with Non-Universal Gaugino Masses and its LHC Signatures
"We develop a theoretical framework based on non-equilibrium stochastic thermodynamics to describe the dynamics of chromatin organization and epigenetic modifications. Chromatin is modeled as an active polymer network, where ATP-dependent remodeling enzymes act as molecular motors, driving the system far from thermal equilibrium. We formulate a Langevin-type equation for chromatin dynamics coupled to a master equation for the discrete epigenetic states (e.g., methylation, acetylation) on histone tails. This coupled system allows us to quantify the thermodynamic cost of maintaining epigenetic memory and executing state transitions. We calculate the entropy production rate associated with chromatin remodeling and demonstrate how it relates to the stability of epigenetic landscapes. Our model predicts a direct link between the metabolic state of the cell (ATP concentration) and the fidelity of epigenetic inheritance, offering a quantitative, physics-based explanation for the observed plasticity and robustness of the epigenome.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Fizik,Generated,Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics of Active Chromatin Networks and Epigenetic State Transitions
"This paper re-examines the foundations of quantum measurement in the presence of additive conservation laws, unifying the Wigner-Araki-Yanase (WAY) theorem with the framework of quantum contextuality. We employ the Contextuality-by-Default (CbD) theory to formalize the notion that measurements of a quantum observable in different experimental contexts (i.e., alongside different sets of co-measured observables) are stochastically unrelated. We demonstrate that the WAY theorem, which constrains the accuracy of measurements for observables that do not commute with a conserved quantity, can be reinterpreted as a form of intrinsic contextuality. Specifically, the impossibility of a perfectly accurate, repeatable measurement is shown to be equivalent to a violation of non-contextuality inequalities in the CbD framework. This approach provides a rigorous, operational meaning to the measurement limitations imposed by conservation laws and clarifies the deep connection between fundamental symmetries and the non-classical structure of quantum probabilities.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Fizik,Generated,Contextuality-by-Default and the Wigner-Araki-Yanase Theorem: Limitations on Quantum Measurements
"Ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) is a crucial cellular surveillance pathway that targets nascent polypeptide chains arising from stalled translation for proteasomal degradation. The E3 ubiquitin ligase Ltn1p is central to this process, yet its structural organization and mechanism of substrate recognition remain elusive. Here, we present the high-resolution cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the yeast 80S RQC complex, captured with a stalled nascent chain, the RQC trigger factor (RQT) complex, and Ltn1p. Our structure reveals how the RQT complex remodels the ribosome to expose the peptidyl-tRNA at the P-site, facilitating Ltn1p engagement. Ltn1p adopts an extended conformation, arching over the ribosomal tunnel exit to position its RING domain for optimal ubiquitination of the nascent chain. Mutational analysis guided by our structure confirms that specific interactions between Ltn1p and both ribosomal proteins and the RQT complex are indispensable for efficient ubiquitination. These findings provide a detailed architectural framework for understanding RQC-mediated proteostasis and its dysregulation in neurodegenerative diseases.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Cryo-EM Structure of the Ribosome Quality Control Complex Reveals the Mechanism of Nascent Chain Ubiquitination
"The reactivation of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) expression is a promising therapeutic strategy for β-hemoglobinopathies like sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia. Transcriptional repression of the γ-globin genes is primarily mediated by the BCL11A transcription factor. Here, we engineered a potent epigenetic editor by fusing a catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) to the catalytic domain of DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A). Guided by single-guide RNAs targeting the BCL11A erythroid-specific enhancer, we achieved robust, targeted DNA hypermethylation in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and bisulfite sequencing confirmed precise epigenetic modification without significant off-target effects. This locus-specific hypermethylation resulted in sustained transcriptional repression of BCL11A, leading to a clinically relevant elevation of HbF levels in differentiated erythroid progeny.

"The cellular heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment (TME) profoundly influences cancer progression and therapeutic response. We employed high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile over 100,000 individual cells from primary and metastatic lesions of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Our analysis resolved distinct subpopulations of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). A novel myofibroblastic CAF subtype, characterized by high expression of POSTN and LOXL2, was significantly enriched in metastatic sites. Trajectory inference analysis suggested its differentiation from resident pancreatic stellate cells. Ligand-receptor interaction modeling predicted a robust paracrine signaling axis between these metastatic CAFs and a specific C1QC-expressing TAM subpopulation. In co-culture and xenograft models, CAF-derived POSTN was shown to induce M2-like polarization in macrophages via integrin signaling, thereby fostering an immunosuppressive and pro-angiogenic niche.

"G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) can selectively activate G-protein or β-arrestin pathways, a phenomenon known as biased agonism, which offers opportunities for developing safer therapeutics. To elucidate the structural basis of this phenomenon, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the human A2A adenosine receptor (A2AAR) in complex with a Gs-biased agonist and the heterotrimeric Gs protein at 2.8 Å resolution. Comparison with the β-arrestin-biased state reveals a distinct conformational rearrangement in the receptor's intracellular loop 2 (ICL2) and transmembrane helix 6 (TM6). The Gs-biased agonist stabilizes an outward TM6 conformation that sterically hinders the engagement of β-arrestin but creates an optimal binding surface for the α-subunit of Gs. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations corroborate that this specific conformation acts as a 'conformational lock,' preventing the receptor from sampling β-arrestin-competent states. These insights into the molecular determinants of GPCR signaling bias provide a blueprint for the rational design of pathway-selective drugs.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Biased Agonism of the A2A Adenosine Receptor Mediated by a Conformational Lock in the G-Protein Binding Interface
"Transcription at key developmental and oncogenic genes is often characterized by high-amplitude bursts, regulated by distal super-enhancers. The underlying mechanism for concentrating transcriptional machinery at these sites remains unclear. We demonstrate that the intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of the bromodomain protein BRD4 and the acetyltransferase p300/CBP co-assemble into liquid-like biomolecular condensates. Using live-cell single-molecule imaging and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), we show these condensates form preferentially at hyper-acetylated super-enhancer regions, where they recruit RNA Polymerase II and the Mediator complex. Perturbation of the IDRs via mutagenesis or treatment with a phase-disrupting agent, 1,6-hexanediol, dissolved these condensates and attenuated transcriptional bursting without affecting basal transcription. Our results support a model in which liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of key chromatin regulators provides a physicochemical basis for the assembly of transcriptional hubs at super-enhancers, thereby driving robust and pulsatile gene expression.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Phase Separation of the BRD4-p300 Complex at Super-Enhancers Orchestrates Transcriptional Bursting
"Local protein synthesis at synapses is critical for long-term synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation. The epitranscriptomic mark N6-methyladenosine (m6A) has emerged as a key regulator of mRNA fate, but its role in synaptic translation remains unknown. Using m6A-sequencing (MeRIP-seq) on synaptoneurosomes isolated from the hippocampus, we identified a distinct pool of m6A-modified transcripts, including those encoding critical plasticity-related proteins like CAMK2A and PSD95. We show that the m6A reader protein YTHDF1 is enriched at synapses and that its conditional knockout in excitatory neurons impairs long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term memory formation. Ribosome profiling and polysome fractionation revealed that YTHDF1 binding promotes the translational efficiency of its target mRNAs in response to synaptic stimulation. This occurs through its interaction with the eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex.

We profiled the proximal interactors of 26 viral proteins throughout the infection cycle. This yielded over 4,000 high-confidence PPIs, revealing extensive viral hijacking of key host processes, including vesicle trafficking, RNA processing, and innate immune signaling. Notably, we identified a previously uncharacterized interaction between the viral nsp14 protein and the host STRIPAK complex, which we show is critical for suppressing interferon-stimulated gene expression.

"The rational design of synthetic genetic circuits with predictable behavior is a cornerstone of synthetic biology, yet achieving robust performance in mammalian cells is challenging due to crosstalk with endogenous networks. We report the construction of a fully orthogonal genetic toggle switch based on mutually repressive transcription activator-like effector (TALE) proteins. The circuit utilizes synthetic promoters with TALE binding sites that lack recognition motifs for endogenous transcription factors. To insulate the circuit from translational regulation, the TALE repressors were designed to be expressed from transcripts containing orthogonal 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). When integrated into HEK293T and CHO cells, the circuit exhibited robust bistability, with stable 'ON' and 'OFF' states that were heritable for over 50 cell divisions. The system's state could be reliably flipped using transient chemical inducers. This highly insulated design provides a foundational component for building complex, multi-layered synthetic circuits for applications in cell-based therapies and biocomputing.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,An Orthogonal TALE-Based Genetic Toggle Switch for Robust Bistability in Mammalian Cells
"Telomeres pose a significant challenge to the DNA replication machinery, leading to frequent replication fork stalling. The mechanisms that ensure fork stability and prevent collapse at these repetitive sequences are not fully understood. We show that the telomeric repeat-binding factor 2 (TRF2), a core component of the shelterin complex, plays a direct role in the replication stress response at telomeres. Using iPONDR (in situ protein-on-nascent-DNA-recognition) and super-resolution microscopy, we demonstrate that TRF2 is rapidly recruited to stalled forks within telomeric DNA. TRF2 recruitment is independent of its telomere tethering function and facilitates the localized accumulation and activation of the ATR kinase. Depletion of TRF2 leads to reduced ATR signaling specifically at telomeres, resulting in fork collapse, increased telomeric sister chromatid exchanges, and elevated chromosomal instability. Our data reveal a novel function for TRF2 as a scaffold protein that orchestrates the ATR-dependent replication stress response to maintain telomere integrity.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,The Shelterin Component TRF2 Modulates ATR Kinase Activity at Stalled Replication Forks to Prevent Telomere Fragility
"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) exhibit distinct metabolic phenotypes that support their self-renewal and therapeutic resistance.

GADIR knockdown in GSCs induced a metabolic shift from aerobic glycolysis towards oxidative phosphorylation, attenuated self-renewal capacity, and sensitized cells to radiation therapy. Mechanistically, chromatin isolation by RNA purification (ChIRP-seq) revealed that GADIR directly binds to the promoter regions of several key tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzyme genes, including SDHB and OGDH. GADIR serves as a scaffold, recruiting the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to these loci, leading to H3K27me3-mediated transcriptional repression. These findings uncover a lncRNA-mediated epigenetic mechanism that governs metabolic plasticity in GSCs, highlighting GADIR as a potential therapeutic target for eradicating the root of gliomas.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Metabolic Reprogramming in Glioma Stem Cells is Driven by the lncRNA GADIR via Epigenetic Silencing of the TCA Cycle
"This paper introduces a novel computational framework for quantifying perceptual consonance in microtonal and xenharmonic harmonic structures.

We propose the Xenharmonic Consonance Metric (XCM), which integrates high-resolution spectral analysis via the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) with a psychoacoustically-informed model of sensory roughness derived from critical band theory. The model's predictions are further refined by a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network trained to capture temporal dependencies in consonance perception. Validated against a corpus of listener ratings for dyads and triads in 19-TET, 31-TET, and Bohlen-Pierce scales, the XCM demonstrates a significant improvement in predictive accuracy (r > 0.92) over existing dissonance curve models.

To visualize the inherent structure of this space, we apply Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique. The resultant low-dimensional embedding reveals a highly structured timbral manifold where instrumental families form distinct, continuous clusters. Furthermore, the geometric distances between points on the manifold correlate strongly with established principles of timbral blending and psychoacoustic similarity. This data-driven approach offers a new paradigm for the empirical analysis of orchestration, providing a computable representation of timbral relationships that can inform both music theory and algorithmic composition.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Mapping the Semantic Space of Orchestral Timbre: A Manifold Learning Approach

"Deviations from metronomic precision are fundamental to expressive musical performance. This paper posits a cognitive model where expressive timing is the result of Bayesian inference under a hierarchical generative model of rhythmic and harmonic expectation. We formalize this by treating performer-generated inter-onset intervals (IOIs) as posterior estimates conditioned on priors encapsulating metrical structure, phrase boundaries, and harmonic tension, the latter quantified via a spiral-array model. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods on a dataset of professional piano recordings of Chopin, we infer the model's latent parameters. Our results demonstrate that phenomena like phrase-final lengthening and agogic accentuation emerge naturally as rational inferences under uncertainty, rather than being mere motor artifacts. The posterior distributions of timing parameters show strong correlations with music-theoretic features, providing a quantitative link between expressive performance practice and the underlying musical structure, and reframing musical expression as a form of probabilistic cognition.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Expressive Performance Timing as Hierarchical Bayesian Inference

Steady-state evoked potentials (SSEPs) were recorded while participants listened to complex rhythmic ratios (e.g., 4:5, 5:7). A continuous wavelet transform (CWT) using a Morlet wavelet was applied to the audio stimuli to extract time-frequency phase information. Inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) was calculated for the EEG data. We found a statistically significant correlation between the ITPC of the neural response at specific frequencies and the phase synchrony patterns revealed by the CWT of the auditory signal.

These constraints reflect the natural characteristics of musical instrument sounds—namely, that instruments play notes sparsely over time and that their spectral envelopes are typically smooth. We evaluate TC-NMF on the MedleyDB dataset for the task of unsupervised instrumental source separation. Results show a statistically significant improvement in Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SDR) and Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR) compared to standard NMF and other state-of-the-art unsupervised methods.

Harmonic Entropy is then defined as the Shannon entropy of the probability distribution of possible continuations from a given harmonic state, weighted by their tonal stability. This metric captures the degree of uncertainty or 'surprisal' an expert listener might experience. We apply the Hₑ metric to famously ambiguous passages, such as the Tristan chord, and trace its evolution through the works of Wagner, Debussy, and Schoenberg.

This allows for explicit, intuitive control over the synthesized texture's character. Trained on a diverse dataset of environmental and musical sounds, PC-WaveGAN synthesizes textures with significantly higher perceptual quality than baseline models, as verified by MUSHRA listening tests.

We employ a variational graph autoencoder to learn this embedding, capturing complex homophilous patterns. These learned latent variables are then incorporated as covariates into a potential outcomes model to adjust for confounding when estimating direct and indirect (spillover) causal effects.

We then establish tight bounds on the Rademacher complexity for deep neural network critics, with an explicit dependence on architectural parameters such as depth, width, and spectral norms of the weight matrices. Our bounds provide a clearer theoretical justification for common regularization techniques like weight decay and spectral normalization in GAN training, illuminating the mechanisms that control generalization performance in the generative setting and explaining their empirical success.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,Generalization Bounds for Deep Generative Models via Wasserstein Distance and Rademacher Complexity
"Standard reversible Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), often exhibit poor mixing when exploring complex, multimodal posterior distributions, as they can become trapped in a single dominant mode. We introduce a novel adaptive, non-reversible MCMC framework designed to efficiently traverse such challenging landscapes. The sampler employs a gradient-based non-reversible kernel, like the Bouncy Particle Sampler (BPS), for rapid local exploration within a mode. This is coupled with a novel adaptation mechanism that monitors geometric properties of the sampler's trajectory to detect modal trapping. Upon detection of stagnation, the sampler dynamically switches to a global mode-jumping kernel, such as one based on parallel tempering, to facilitate inter-modal transitions. The switching protocol is carefully designed to preserve the target stationary distribution. Empirical results on intractable Bayesian mixture models and geophysical inverse problems demonstrate orders-of-magnitude improvement in convergence speed compared to state-of-the-art HMC and static BPS.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,Adaptive Non-Reversible Markov Chain Monte Carlo for Multimodal Posterior Distributions
"Cryptic speciation is a significant component of biodiversity, yet the genomic architecture underlying incipient reproductive isolation remains poorly understood, particularly in extreme environments. We investigate this phenomenon in the vent-endemic gastropod genus *Alviniconcha*. Using whole-genome sequencing and RAD-seq for over 300 individuals from disparate vent fields across the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge, we uncovered multiple deeply divergent, non-interbreeding lineages. Phylogenetic network analysis and demographic modeling support a scenario of allopatric divergence driven by vicariance events linked to hydrothermal vent field lifespans. We identified specific genomic islands of high differentiation (FST outliers) enriched for genes involved in chemosensory perception, detoxification, and metabolic pathways related to chemosynthetic symbionts. These findings reveal a surprising level of cryptic biodiversity in chemosynthetic ecosystems and demonstrate that ecological specialization can be a powerful driver of reproductive isolation even in the absence of obvious morphological change, reshaping our understanding of speciation processes in the deep sea.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Genomic Signatures of Cryptic Speciation and Ecological Divergence in Hydrothermal Vent Gastropods
"The evolution of the mammalian placenta was a key innovation, yet the origins of its unique syncytial cell layers remain enigmatic. We hypothesize that ancient endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) provided the fusogenic genes necessary for this development. Through a comprehensive phylogenomic analysis of syncytin-like genes across 150 mammalian genomes, we identified multiple independent ERV capture events at the base of major clades. Our results demonstrate convergent evolution, where distinct retroviral *env* genes were co-opted to fulfill the same cell-fusion function. Using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout in murine trophoblast stem cells, we confirmed the functional necessity of Syncytin-A and -B for cell-cell fusion and normal placentation. Ancestral sequence reconstruction and structural modeling suggest that positive selection acted on the ectodomains of these co-opted proteins, likely to evade host immune responses while retaining fusogenic activity. This study provides compelling evidence that ERV co-option was a recurrent and fundamental molecular mechanism driving macroevolutionary innovation in mammalian reproduction.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Ancient Retroviral Endogenization as a Catalyst for Synytiotrophoblast Evolution in Mammals
"The contribution of non-genetic inheritance to adaptation is a central debate in evolutionary biology. We investigated the role of transgenerational epigenetic memory in response to environmental stress using experimental evolution in *Arabidopsis thaliana*. Replicate populations were subjected to recurrent drought stress for ten generations. We employed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and RNA-seq to track changes in DNA methylation patterns and gene expression. We found that stress-adapted lineages exhibited significantly higher fitness under drought, an advantage that persisted for at least three generations after stress removal. This adaptive phenotype was strongly correlated with heritable differential methylation in the promoter regions of genes involved in ABA signaling and osmotic stress response. These differentially methylated regions (DMRs) acted as quantitative trait loci (eQTMs), modulating transcriptional plasticity. Our results demonstrate that inherited epigenetic modifications can provide a rapid, quasi-Lamarckian mechanism for adaptation, complementing genetic selection in fluctuating environments.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Transgenerational Epigenetic Inheritance Confers Rapid Adaptive Potential to Environmental Stress
"The interplay between the host genome and its microbiome is a critical axis of evolution, yet its role in shaping adaptive radiations is poorly defined. We examined this dynamic in the cichlid fishes of Lake Tanganyika. By integrating 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of gut microbiota with whole-genome resequencing of 25 sympatric cichlid species, we reveal a strong phylogenetic signal in microbiome composition, indicating host-genetic control and long-term co-evolution. We identified significant correlations between microbial community structure and divergence in host major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes. Taxa with expanded MHC diversity harbored more species-rich microbiomes. Furthermore, phylogenetic comparative methods show that evolutionary shifts in diet are tightly linked to parallel shifts in both microbial functional guilds and specific immune gene families involved in pathogen recognition. These findings suggest a tripartite co-evolutionary feedback loop between diet, microbiome, and host immunity that facilitates niche partitioning and potentially accelerates speciation.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Co-evolutionary Dynamics of Host Immune Genes and Gut Microbiome Composition in an Adaptive Radiation of Cichlid Fishes
"The phylogenetic placement of ctenophores and sponges remains one of the most contentious issues in animal evolution. Traditional phylogenetic methods are often confounded by systematic biases such as long-branch attraction. Here, we leverage single-cell transcriptomics to generate high-quality gene expression profiles from multiple cell types across several key ctenophore and poriferan species. By performing orthogroup clustering and constructing phylogenies based on cell-type-specific gene sets, we mitigate biases from highly divergent genes expressed ubiquitously. Our synteny-aware, site-heterogeneous models robustly place Ctenophora as the sister group to all other Metazoa. Furthermore, we identify a core set of pan-metazoan transcription factors involved in cell differentiation that were previously thought to be eumetazoan-specific.

"Predicting evolutionary trajectories is a fundamental goal of biology, but it is often hindered by the complex mapping between genotype and fitness. We investigated the predictability of adaptation in replicate populations from the *E. coli* long-term evolution experiment (LTEE) using genome-wide mutation tracking and fitness assays of engineered alleles. While parallel evolution was common at the gene level (e.g., in *pykF* and *nadR*), the specific adaptive mutations were highly contingent on the genetic background. We uncovered extensive sign epistasis, where mutations beneficial in early-generation clones were deleterious in later, more-fit backgrounds. This epistatic sign-reversal is largely attributable to antagonistic pleiotropy, where initial mutations optimized one metabolic flux at the cost of another, constraining subsequent evolutionary pathways. These results demonstrate that while the general targets of selection are predictable, the specific genetic solutions are historically contingent, governed by a rugged fitness landscape dominated by pleiotropic constraints and higher-order epistasis.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Pleiotropic Constraints and Sign Epistasis Shape the Predictability of Evolution in a Long-Term Experiment
"The emergence of antibiotic resistance poses a global health crisis, yet our ability to predict evolutionary escape pathways is limited. We used deep mutational scanning to systematically quantify the effects of all possible single amino acid substitutions in the TEM-1 β-lactamase enzyme on its ability to hydrolyze a third-generation cephalosporin, cefotaxime. The resulting empirical fitness landscape reveals a sparse network of beneficial mutations, many of which are located far from the active site, suggesting allosteric mechanisms of functional enhancement. We identified multiple distinct evolutionary trajectories to high-level resistance, characterized by significant epistatic interactions where the fitness effect of a mutation is conditional on the presence of others. Notably, several pathways involve transiently deleterious or neutral intermediate steps, highlighting the potential for stochastic tunneling through non-adaptive valleys. These high-resolution fitness maps provide critical data for forecasting resistance evolution and can inform the design of evolution-proof antimicrobial strategies.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Quantifying the Fitness Landscape of Antibiotic Resistance Evolution via Deep Mutational Scanning
"Adaptive introgression, the transfer of beneficial alleles between species, is a significant mechanism of rapid evolution. The genetic basis for high-altitude adaptation in Tibetan populations, linked to the *EPAS1* gene, is a classic example. We analyzed whole-genome sequences from diverse Eurasian populations alongside archaic hominin genomes (Neanderthal and Denisovan) to trace the origin of the adaptive *EPAS1* haplotype. Using conditional random field models and identity-by-descent tract analysis, we demonstrate that the entire ~32 kb haplotype block associated with high-altitude adaptation originated in Denisovan-related hominins and introgressed into the ancestors of modern East Asians. The allelic frequency spectrum at this locus shows a deep divergence time incompatible with an origin within *Homo sapiens*. This finding represents one of the clearest cases of adaptive introgression in humans, illustrating how admixture with archaic populations provided pre-adapted genetic variants that were critical for colonization of extreme environments.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Archaic Hominin Introgression Facilitated High-Altitude Adaptation in Anatomically Modern Humans
"Phenotypic heterogeneity within isogenic populations can be an adaptive bet-hedging strategy in unpredictable environments. We explored the evolutionary dynamics of this phenomenon by combining theoretical modeling with experimental evolution in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. Our stochastic population models predict that noisy gene expression is favored when environmental fluctuations occur on timescales comparable to cell division rates. To test this, we evolved replicate yeast populations in environments with predictably fluctuating carbon sources. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and fluorescent reporter assays, we observed the rapid evolution of increased transcriptional noise in key metabolic genes, such as the GALactose utilization network. This increased heterogeneity was caused by specific cis-regulatory mutations that altered transcription factor binding affinity and chromatin state, leading to more probabilistic transcriptional bursting. Our results provide direct experimental evidence that selection can tune the level of stochastic gene expression to optimize population fitness, establishing non-genetic individuality as a key evolvable trait.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Stochastic Gene Expression as a Bet-Hedging Strategy in Fluctuating Environments
"The evolution of cellular complexity is intrinsically linked to the expansion of signaling networks. The relative contributions of whole gene duplication (WGD) and exon/domain shuffling to the genesis of regulatory novelty, however, remain debated. We performed a comprehensive phylogenomic and structural analysis of the tyrosine kinase superfamily across 200 eukaryotic genomes, tracing the evolutionary history of individual protein domains and full-length genes. Our results show that while WGD events, particularly the two rounds in early vertebrates, provided raw genetic material, the subsequent functional diversification was primarily driven by the shuffling of SH2, SH3, and other regulatory domains. We found that novel domain architectures arose at a significantly higher rate following duplication events, suggesting a 'duplication-and-diversify' model. These new architectures facilitated the emergence of new protein-protein interactions, effectively rewiring signaling pathways. This work highlights the synergistic interplay between duplication and shuffling in constructing the complex gene regulatory networks that underpin organismal complexity.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,The Evolutionary Origins of Complex Signaling Networks: Gene Duplication versus Domain Shuffling
"The analysis of non-standard tuning systems in polyphonic music presents a significant challenge for conventional audio analysis techniques predicated on 12-tone equal temperament. This paper introduces a novel unsupervised framework based on a β-variational autoencoder (β-VAE) to learn latent representations of microtonal tunings directly from audio signals. The model's encoder, a convolutional neural network, maps log-frequency spectrograms to a disentangled latent space, while the decoder reconstructs the spectral information. By imposing a prior on a specific latent dimension corresponding to pitch-class distribution, the model effectively infers the underlying temperament and centroids of a given piece without any labeled data. We evaluate our approach on a synthetic dataset of xenharmonic compositions and real-world recordings of Gamelan and Arabic Maqam music.

"Automating Schenkerian analysis, the hierarchical parsing of tonal music, remains a formidable task in computational musicology due to its structural complexity and theoretical abstraction. We propose a probabilistic generative model that formalizes Schenkerian principles within a hierarchical Bayesian framework. The model represents the generation of a musical surface (foreground) as a stochastic process conditioned on latent middleground and background structures, including the Ursatz. This hierarchical dependency is encoded in a graphical model where nodes represent musical events and edges represent reductive relationships. We employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, specifically Gibbs sampling, to perform inference and deduce the most probable Schenkerian graph for a given symbolic musical input. Tested on a corpus of Bach chorales and Mozart piano sonatas, our model generates analyses that exhibit high concordance with expert human annotations, successfully identifying key prolongational spans and structural tones. This approach provides a scalable method for large-scale structural analysis of the tonal repertoire.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Probabilistic Generative Models for Automated Schenkerian Analysis via Hierarchical Bayesian Inference

We first compute a high-dimensional feature vector for a comprehensive database of solo instrument samples, incorporating spectral descriptors such as MFCCs, spectral flux, and tristimulus values. Subsequently, we apply Isomap and Laplacian Eigenmaps to embed these feature vectors into a low-dimensional manifold. The resultant geometric representation captures perceptually salient relationships between instruments. We validate the manifold's structure by demonstrating that geodesic distances along its surface correlate strongly (ρ > 0.85) with human listener ratings of timbral similarity. Furthermore, we show that specific axes of the learned space correspond to semantic descriptors like 'brightness' and 'roughness'.

A comprehensive set of audio features—including fundamental frequency contours, dynamic envelopes, and timbral descriptors—was extracted. The DCCA model, comprising two deep neural networks, learns a shared latent space in which the correlation between the projected representations of gesture and audio is maximized. The learned canonical variates successfully encode high-level expressive concepts like vibrato extent and attack articulation.

"Polyphonic pitch detection is a notoriously difficult inverse problem, often framed as a combinatorial optimization task.

The problem is formulated as minimizing a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model, whose energy function (or Hamiltonian) encodes music-theoretic constraints. This function rewards spectral component explanations based on harmonic series, penalizes psychoacoustic roughness, and encourages temporal continuity of pitch tracks. By mapping the spectrum to this energy landscape, a quantum-inspired annealing solver can efficiently find the global minimum, corresponding to the most plausible multi-pitch estimate. Evaluated on the Bach10 and MIREX multi-F0 estimation datasets under various signal-to-noise ratios, our method demonstrates superior accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art NMF and deep learning approaches, particularly in acoustically dense and degraded conditions, proposing a new direction for signal processing challenges.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Quantum-Inspired Annealing for Robust Polyphonic Pitch Detection in Noisy Environments

Using a specialized subgraph isomorphism search algorithm, we efficiently identify recurring and structurally significant transformational pathways within a given musical work or corpus. We apply this methodology to a large dataset of works by Wagner, Liszt, and Scriabin.

Our approach utilizes a Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPMM) where each mixture component corresponds to a distinct pitch category. This allows the number of scale degrees to be determined by the data itself, avoiding the imposition of a priori assumptions inherent in Western tonal theory. The model's posterior distribution yields robust estimates of pitch-class centroids and their associated uncertainty, even from spectrally ambiguous data.

This prior is derived from a concurrent probabilistic model of harmonic progression, which calculates the likelihood of vertical sonorities (chords) at each time frame. The NMF's activation matrix is then regularized to favor spectral templates whose joint activations correspond to harmonically consonant structures. This synergy between signal-level decomposition and symbolic-level harmonic analysis significantly reduces crosstalk and artifact generation.

Treating the stylistic evolution of composers as a multivariate time series, we apply the Peter-Clark (PC) algorithm, a constraint-based causal discovery method, to learn the structure of the underlying Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of influence. The resulting graph controls for confounding variables (e.g., shared cultural context) and distinguishes direct influence from mere correlation. Our findings recover many historically established influence pathways while also revealing previously unposited connections, providing an empirical, data-driven methodology to investigate cultural transmission and the evolution of musical style.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Discovering Musical Influence Networks using Causal Discovery Algorithms on a Large-Scale Symbolic Corpus

"The three-dimensional organization of the genome is critical for gene regulation, yet the molecular mechanisms governing the formation of insulated neighborhoods remain incompletely understood.

Using high-resolution chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) and super-resolution microscopy, we demonstrate that ChROMA localizes to specific CTCF/cohesin binding sites, strengthening their insulator activity. Mechanistically, ChROMA possesses intrinsically disordered regions that drive liquid-liquid phase separation, forming transcriptional condensates that recruit and stabilize the CTCF-cohesin complex. Depletion of ChROMA results in the dissolution of these condensates, weakening TAD boundaries and leading to aberrant enhancer-promoter communication, as evidenced by promoter-capture Hi-C.

The core is enriched in ATP-dependent RNA helicases and core nucleating proteins like G3BP1, while the shell is populated by proteins involved in mRNA decay and translational re-initiation. Super-resolution microscopy validates this structure. We demonstrate that mRNAs destined for degradation are preferentially localized to the shell, while mRNAs slated for storage and later translation are sequestered in the core.

"Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in settings with partial observability and non-stationary opponents remains a formidable challenge. We propose Counterfactual Policy Gradients (CPG), a scalable MARL algorithm that enables decentralized agents to coordinate complex strategies. CPG extends single-agent policy gradient methods by incorporating a centralized critic that computes a counterfactual advantage function. This function isolates an individual agent's contribution to the global reward, mitigating the credit assignment problem. To handle non-stationarity, the critic is conditioned on an inferred belief state of opponent policies, modeled via a recurrent neural network. This allows agents to dynamically adapt their strategies. We prove that CPG converges to a correlated equilibrium under specific assumptions. Empirically, CPG achieves superior performance and faster convergence in challenging coordination benchmarks, including cooperative navigation and stochastic games, outperforming existing value-decomposition and independent learning methods, especially under high degrees of partial observability.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,"Counterfactual Policy Gradients for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Non-Stationary, Partially Observable Environments"
"Federated learning (FL) struggles with statistical heterogeneity across clients, leading to client drift and suboptimal model personalization. To address this, we present Personalized Meta-Federated Learning (PMFL), a novel framework that leverages hypernetworks and meta-learning. Instead of learning a single global model, PMFL trains a central hypernetwork that generates client-specific model parameters based on a low-dimensional client embedding. These embeddings are learned concurrently and capture the unique data distribution characteristics of each client. The meta-learning objective is formulated to optimize the hypernetwork for fast adaptation on local client data, effectively learning to personalize. This approach mitigates client drift by decoupling the shared knowledge (in the hypernetwork) from the personalized parameters. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees and demonstrate empirically on several non-IID datasets that PMFL significantly outperforms canonical FL methods like FedAvg and state-of-the-art personalization techniques in terms of accuracy, fairness, and communication efficiency.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Personalized Meta-Federated Learning via Hypernetwork-Modulated Client Adaptation
"Randomized smoothing is a scalable, provable method for certifying the robustness of neural networks against adversarial perturbations. However, its effectiveness is often limited in pixel space, especially for large perturbation radii. We propose Latent Diffeomorphic Smoothing (LDS), a novel certification framework that applies smoothing in a semantically meaningful latent space of a generative model. We first train a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a diffeomorphic flow-based decoder, ensuring that the latent space topology is well-behaved. The classifier is then trained on latent representations of clean data. For certification, we propagate the L_p-norm-bounded perturbation from the input space through the encoder to the latent space and compute a certified radius for a smoothed version of the latent classifier. Our key theoretical contribution is a method to tightly bound the propagated perturbation in the latent space. LDS yields significantly larger certified radii and higher certified accuracy on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet compared to state-of-the-art smoothing techniques.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Certified Adversarial Robustness via Latent Space Randomized Smoothing with Diffeomorphic Transformations
"Estimating causal effects from observational data is hampered by unobserved confounding. Instrumental variable (IV) methods offer a potential solution but are challenging to apply with high-dimensional instruments and treatments. We introduce the Variational Causal Network (VCN), a deep learning framework for robust causal effect estimation in the presence of complex confounding. The VCN employs a variational autoencoder architecture to learn a low-dimensional latent representation of the treatment that is informed by the instruments but is unconfounded with the outcome. Causal effects are then estimated via a two-stage regression process within this latent space. We formulate a novel evidence lower bound objective that explicitly encourages independence between the learned representation and the confounders. We demonstrate through extensive simulation studies and application to real-world econometric and biomedical datasets that VCN consistently outperforms existing deep IV methods, especially under conditions of instrument weakness and high-dimensional, non-linear confounding structures.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Deep Instrumental Variable Regression with Variational Causal Networks for High-Dimensional Confounding
"Real-world systems are characterized by dynamic, higher-order interactions that cannot be sufficiently modeled by pairwise static graphs. We introduce the Temporal Hypergraph Neural Network with Attentional Point Process Aggregation (THAP), a novel architecture for representation learning on dynamic hypergraphs. Unlike conventional GNNs, THAP explicitly models the multi-way, time-dependent nature of interactions. Each hyperedge's temporal evolution is modeled as a neural temporal point process, which informs the time-aware aggregation of node features. We propose a novel, fully-attentional message passing scheme where attention weights are functions of both node states and the inter-event time intervals, allowing the model to capture complex temporal dependencies within higher-order structures. THAP operates on continuous-time data without requiring discrete snapshots. We evaluate our model on dynamic node classification and link prediction tasks using several real-world datasets, including co-authorship networks and social interaction data, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art dynamic graph and hypergraph models.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Temporal Hypergraph Neural Networks with Attentional Point Process Aggregation
"Standard Transformer architectures struggle to efficiently capture hierarchical structures and complex relational dependencies inherent in sequential data. We propose Quaternion-based Rotational Attention (QRA), a novel attention mechanism that embeds tokens in the quaternion space H and utilizes Hamilton products to model compositional relationships. Instead of dot-product similarity, QRA computes attention scores based on rotational alignment between query and key vectors, effectively encoding relative positional and hierarchical information. The value vectors are rotated by learned quaternion transformations, enabling a more expressive synthesis of information. This approach introduces a strong relational inductive bias with minimal parameter overhead compared to standard multi-head attention. We integrate QRA into a Transformer architecture and demonstrate its superior performance on tasks requiring hierarchical reasoning, such as algorithmic problem-solving, code generation, and long-range natural language inference. QRA not only improves accuracy but also exhibits enhanced data efficiency and generalization to out-of-distribution sequence lengths.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Quaternion-based Rotational Attention for Capturing Hierarchical and Relational Inductive Biases in Transformers
"Meta-learning algorithms aim to learn adaptable models from a distribution of tasks. However, most methods provide point estimates, failing to quantify uncertainty during few-shot adaptation. We introduce Amortized Bayesian Meta-Learning (ABML), a scalable framework for learning a posterior distribution over functions that can be rapidly updated with new task data. We frame meta-learning as hierarchical Bayesian inference and employ functional variational inference, where a hyper-network amortizes the inference process by mapping a task's dataset to an approximate posterior in function space. This posterior is represented by a Bayesian neural network. ABML not only facilitates fast adaptation but also provides well-calibrated epistemic uncertainty estimates, which are crucial for active learning and out-of-distribution detection in few-shot settings. We evaluate ABML on challenging few-shot regression and classification benchmarks, showing it achieves competitive predictive performance while providing superior uncertainty quantification compared to prominent meta-learning algorithms like MAML and prototypical networks.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Amortized Bayesian Meta-Learning with Functional Variational Inference for Few-Shot Adaptation
"Ensuring fairness in machine learning models is critical, yet challenging for black-box systems where the internal logic is inaccessible. We propose Generative Adversarial Deconfounding (GAD), a novel framework for auditing and mitigating counterfactual fairness violations in any pre-trained model. GAD operates by learning a structural causal model of the data-generating process. It employs a generative adversarial network, conditioned on sensitive attributes, to generate counterfactual data points—synthetic examples of what would have happened had an individual's sensitive attribute been different, while holding all other background factors constant. By feeding these counterfactual pairs to the black-box model, we can directly measure individual and group-level counterfactual fairness. For mitigation, the generated counterfactuals are used to augment the training data for a new, debiased model. We demonstrate GAD's efficacy in identifying and rectifying fairness violations in commercial AI systems for loan applications and recidivism prediction, outperforming existing fairness auditing techniques.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Counterfactual Fairness Auditing and Mitigation using Generative Adversarial Deconfounding
"Quantifying predictive uncertainty is paramount for deploying deep learning models in safety-critical domains. Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) provide a principled framework but are often computationally intractable. We propose the Neural Stochastic Differential Equation (NSDE) framework, a scalable alternative for learning and inference in deep models. We model the evolution of network weights during training as an Itô stochastic process, governed by a learnable drift and diffusion term. The training objective minimizes the KL-divergence between the trajectory of the learned SDE and a target posterior process. This perspective unifies stochastic gradient MCMC methods and deep ensembles under a single continuous-time framework. At inference time, predictions are made by solving the learned SDE forward in time, yielding a distribution over outputs. Our method produces well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, scales to large architectures like ResNets, and achieves state-of-the-art results on out-of-distribution detection and adversarial robustness benchmarks, outperforming deep ensembles and variational BNNs.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Neural Stochastic Differential Equations for Scalable and Calibrated Uncertainty Quantification in Deep Learning
"We present a novel framework for modeling large-scale, non-stationary spatiotemporal data. The core of our model is a latent Gaussian Process (GP) whose covariance structure is implicitly defined through a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE). Non-stationarity is introduced by allowing the parameters of the SPDE, such as diffusivity and advection, to vary spatially as a function of covariates. For computational tractability, we employ a finite element method (FEM) representation, which transforms the latent GP into a Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF) with a sparse precision matrix. Inference is performed using Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations (INLA), enabling rapid and accurate posterior marginal estimation without resorting to MCMC. This circumvents the prohibitive cubic complexity of standard GP regression. We demonstrate the model's flexibility and scalability on a large dataset of global sea surface temperatures, capturing complex, spatially varying anisotropic dynamics missed by stationary and simpler non-stationary models.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,A Scalable Bayesian Hierarchical Model for Non-Stationary Spatiotemporal Processes using Latent Stochastic Differential Equations
"This paper addresses the problem of estimating average treatment effects (ATE) in observational studies with high-dimensional confounders. We propose a debiased machine learning framework that leverages cross-fitting and orthogonalized moment functions to construct a robust estimator. The procedure utilizes flexible, non-parametric learners (e.g., gradient boosting, random forests) to estimate the nuisance functions—the propensity score and the conditional outcome mean—thereby mitigating bias from model misspecification. By solving a Neyman-orthogonal moment equation, our estimator is rendered first-order insensitive to errors in the nuisance function estimation, a key property for achieving semi-parametric efficiency. We prove that the resulting estimator is asymptotically normal and consistent under weaker sparsity assumptions than required by competing methods like the double-LASSO. Finite-sample performance is evaluated via extensive Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating superior bias reduction and nominal confidence interval coverage compared to standard doubly robust estimators and targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE).",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,Debiased Machine Learning for Doubly Robust Treatment Effect Estimation with High-Dimensional Confounders
"We introduce a novel framework for conducting statistical inference on topological features derived from persistent homology. A central challenge in topological data analysis (TDA) is quantifying the uncertainty of persistence diagrams, which often precludes formal hypothesis testing. Our proposed method, the multi-scale bootstrap, constructs confidence regions for persistence diagrams by resampling from a kernel density estimate of the underlying data-generating distribution at multiple bandwidths. This approach corrects for bootstrap inconsistencies that arise in standard subsampling schemes for topological summaries. We establish the theoretical validity of our method, proving its consistency in the bottleneck and Wasserstein metrics under mild regularity conditions. The procedure yields valid p-values for the existence of topological features (e.g., loops, voids) and enables the construction of confidence bands for persistence landscapes. Its efficacy is demonstrated in differentiating cosmological models from N-body simulations and in analyzing structural variations in cryo-EM protein data.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,Statistically Rigorous Inference for Persistent Homology using a Multi-Scale Bootstrap

Furthermore, we integrate node-specific, time-varying covariates into the edge-formation probability matrix via a logistic link function, allowing for interpretable inference on the drivers of network dynamics. We develop a scalable variational expectation-maximization (VEM) algorithm for posterior inference, which jointly estimates community assignments, model parameters, and covariate effects.

Our approach defines principal geodesic components via a Karhunen-Loève expansion in the tangent space at the Fréchet mean of the observed functional data. We propose an iterative estimation algorithm based on principal geodesic analysis and local linearization, effectively mapping the manifold-valued problem into a sequence of vector-space FPCA problems. We establish theoretical convergence rates for the estimated mean and eigenfunctions under mild geometric and smoothness assumptions.

This unified framework allows for simultaneous robust parameter estimation, sparse variable selection, and explicit outlier detection. We develop an efficient block coordinate descent algorithm that leverages majorization-minimization principles to handle the non-convexity of certain M-estimators. Theoretical analysis establishes oracle properties for the coefficient and outlier parameter estimators under specific regularity conditions, ensuring consistency in both variable selection and outlier identification.

The resulting class of transformation models includes both the proportional subdistribution hazards and proportional odds models as special cases. We formulate the estimation procedure using a system of generalized estimating equations based on inverse probability of censoring weights. This approach naturally handles right-censored data and time-varying covariates. We establish the asymptotic normality and consistency of the resulting estimators for both the regression coefficients and the transformation function.

"We derive novel PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds for deep neural networks that account for the non-Gaussian, heavy-tailed nature of empirically successful weight distributions. Classical PAC-Bayes bounds, often based on Gaussian priors and posteriors, yield vacuous results for overparameterized models. Our framework leverages α-stable distributions as priors and develops a corresponding change-of-measure inequality tailored to these distributions. The resulting bound depends on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between a heavy-tailed prior and a data-dependent posterior, explicitly characterizing the trade-off between empirical risk and model complexity measured in a geometry sensitive to tail behavior. This analysis provides a theoretical justification for using heavy-tailed regularizers, showing how they can induce a form of sparsity that leads to tighter, non-vacuous generalization guarantees. Our bounds are among the first to formally connect the implicit bias of optimization algorithms favoring flat, heavy-tailed minima with provable generalization performance.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,PAC-Bayesian Generalization Bounds for Deep Neural Networks with Heavy-Tailed Priors

Existing methods fail to adequately address this complex scenario. We propose a novel two-stage regression approach that combines variable selection with g-computation. In the first stage, we use a penalized regression model to identify the subset of the high-dimensional mediator that actively mediates the treatment effect. In the second stage, we use a sequential g-formula to estimate the counterfactual outcomes needed for the mediation effects, correctly adjusting for the post-treatment confounding.

Here, we elucidate the molecular basis of the interaction between the catalytic subunit, TERT, and the chaperone TRAP1 (TNF receptor-associated protein 1). Using cryo-electron microscopy and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we reveal a specific interface where the N-terminal domain of TERT engages the ATPase domain of TRAP1. This interaction is ATP-dependent and facilitates a conformational rearrangement in the TERT TEN domain, priming it for efficient binding of the telomerase RNA component (TR). Functional assays using CRISPR-engineered cell lines with mutations at the interface demonstrate impaired telomerase activity and accelerated telomere shortening.

"Epigenetic reprogramming is a hallmark of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), yet the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. We investigated the role of KDM6A, a histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) demethylase, in PDAC pathogenesis. Integrated analysis of ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data from patient-derived organoids revealed that KDM6A loss-of-function mutations lead to hypermethylation of H3K27 at key developmental gene enhancers, suppressing lineage-specifying transcription factors like GATA6. This epigenetic silencing induces a switch towards a quasi-mesenchymal, progenitor-like state characterized by heightened invasiveness and therapeutic resistance. Mechanistically, KDM6A is recruited to chromatin by FOXA1, and its absence permits the unopposed activity of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). Pharmacological inhibition of the PRC2 catalytic subunit EZH2 partially restores the epithelial phenotype and sensitizes KDM6A-deficient tumors to chemotherapy, highlighting a synthetic lethal strategy for this aggressive PDAC subtype.

"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as critical regulators of neuronal function. We identified LINC01234, a previously uncharacterized lncRNA highly expressed in the hippocampus. Using in situ hybridization, we localized LINC01234 to dendritic compartments of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Bioinformatic analysis and subsequent luciferase reporter assays identified multiple binding sites for miR-124, a microRNA known to repress synaptic protein synthesis. Overexpression of LINC01234 in primary hippocampal cultures sequestered endogenous miR-124, leading to the de-repression of its target, GRIA2, which encodes the AMPA receptor subunit GluA2. Electrophysiological recordings from acute hippocampal slices demonstrated that LINC01234 knockdown impairs long-term potentiation (LTP), a phenotype rescued by a miR-124 inhibitor.

The molecular grammar governing their assembly is complex. Here, we demonstrate that the DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX3X is a pivotal scaffold for SG formation. Using live-cell imaging and in vitro reconstitution assays, we show that DDX3X contains intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) that undergo LLPS upon ATP depletion or in the presence of RNA. This process is nucleated by G3BP1 but is critically dependent on the multivalent RNA-binding capacity of DDX3X. Optogenetic clustering of DDX3X is sufficient to induce bona fide SG formation. Furthermore, phosphomimetic mutations within its N-terminal IDR, which are known to occur during stress, enhance its phase separation propensity.

"Cellular senescence is a complex stress response implicated in aging and age-related diseases. While typically associated with the p53 and p16/Rb pathways, alternative mechanisms remain to be explored. We report that mitochondrial dysfunction, induced by mild inhibition of the electron transport chain, triggers a robust senescence program independent of canonical DNA damage signaling. This phenotype is characterized by the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) into the cytosol. Using immunofluorescence and cellular fractionation, we show this cytosolic mtDNA is recognized by the DNA sensor cGAS, leading to the activation of the STING-TBK1-IRF3 signaling axis. This results in a type-I interferon response and the establishment of a unique Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP) enriched in pro-inflammatory cytokines.

"Autophagy is a catabolic process critical for cellular homeostasis. Beyond its canonical role in bulk degradation, non-canonical autophagy pathways have emerged as key regulators of inflammation. We investigated the mechanism by which ATG16L1, a core autophagy protein, suppresses NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Following lysosomal damage, a known inflammasome trigger, we observed that galectin-3 coats the ruptured organelle and is subsequently ubiquitinated by the E3 ligase TRIM16. The WD40 domain of ATG16L1 directly binds this polyubiquitin signal, recruiting the LC3 conjugation machinery to the single damaged membrane. This process, termed LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP)-like, engulfs the damaged lysosome and sequesters inflammasome components, preventing caspase-1 activation and pyroptotic cell death. In ATG16L1-deficient cells, this sequestration fails, leading to hyper-inflammation.

We observed that MutS transitions between 'open' and 'closed' conformations on homoduplex DNA with low frequency. Upon encountering a mismatch, the equilibrium shifts dramatically towards a long-lived, tightly-clamped 'closed' state, which is competent for ATP binding. This conformational switch is characterized by a significant kinking of the DNA helix.

Using a multi-level selection model incorporating noisy gene regulatory networks, we demonstrate that phenotypic heterogeneity arising from transcriptional stochasticity can stabilize cooperative behaviors in environments with unpredictable social dynamics. Our simulations show that when the fitness benefits of altruism are variable, clonal populations with high transcriptional noise outperform those with canalized expression by producing a persistent minority of selfish individuals that thrive under specific adverse conditions, thereby preventing population extinction. This 'stochastic social polymorphism' bypasses the need for complex conditional strategies or kin recognition, suggesting that non-genetic individuality can be a potent substrate for the evolution of cooperation, particularly in microbial populations where environmental feedback on gene expression is immediate and profound.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Stochastic Gene Expression as a Mechanism for Stabilizing Altruism in Fluctuating Social Environments

Using site-heterogeneous mixture models (e.g., CAT-GTR) and coalescent-based species tree methods, we reveal pervasive gene-tree/species-tree incongruence. While our supermatrix analyses weakly support a Ctenophora-sister topology, quartet sampling and Bayesian concordance analyses indicate substantial conflict attributable to both incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and long-branch attraction (LBA) artifacts. We demonstrate that removal of fast-evolving gene families and application of data-recoding schemes significantly erodes support for this topology, favoring a more traditional Porifera-sister relationship. Our results underscore the profound impact of model misspecification and systemic biases in deep phylogenomics, suggesting that resolving the earliest animal divergences may require integrative approaches that explicitly model heterotachy and compositional heterogeneity.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Phylogenomic Reconstruction of Early Metazoan Divergence Reveals Pervasive Incongruence Driven by Long-Branch Attraction and Incomplete Lineage Sorting

We performed a comparative genomic analysis across 45 avian species with varying mating systems, quantifying rates of protein evolution (dN/dS) for over 1,500 genes involved in spermatogenesis and female sperm storage. Using phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) models, we found a strong positive correlation between the degree of polyandry and accelerated evolution in a specific subset of seminal fluid proteins and sperm motility genes. Conversely, genes associated with female sperm storage crypts showed elevated evolutionary rates in the same polyandrous lineages. These reciprocal patterns of rapid evolution provide robust genomic evidence for an ongoing coevolutionary arms race driven by interlocus sexual conflict over fertilization.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Genomic Signatures of Interlocus Sexual Conflict: Accelerated Evolution of Spermatogenesis-Related Genes in Polyandrous Avian Lineages
"The role of cryptic genetic variation (CGV)—standing genetic variation that is phenotypically silent under normal conditions—in adaptation is poorly understood. We tested its contribution to rapid adaptation using experimental evolution in *Drosophila melanogaster*. Populations were maintained for 200 generations under a stable environment to allow CGV accumulation, followed by exposure to a novel, high-temperature selective regime. We observed a punctuated burst of adaptation, with thermal tolerance increasing significantly within 10 generations. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and pooled-sequencing time-series data revealed that this rapid response was primarily driven by frequency shifts in numerous pre-existing, low-frequency alleles, many located in non-coding regions. These variants exhibited significant epistatic interactions and were associated with genes involved in heat-shock response and protein folding. Our results empirically demonstrate that the unmasking of CGV by environmental perturbation can fuel rapid, polygenic adaptation, providing a mechanistic basis for the punctuated equilibria model of evolution.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Unmasking Cryptic Genetic Variation as a Primary Driver of Punctuated Adaptive Evolution
"The moa-nalos were giant, flightless, herbivorous waterfowl endemic to the Hawaiian Islands, whose evolutionary origins are debated. We successfully sequenced complete mitochondrial genomes from subfossil remains of three distinct moa-nalo species. Utilizing a tip-dating Bayesian phylogenetic framework calibrated with fossil evidence and accounting for post-mortem DNA damage patterns, we unequivocally place the moa-nalos as the sister lineage to modern dabbling ducks (tribe Anatini). The divergence time estimate of ~3.6 Mya suggests a single colonization event. Furthermore, analysis of protein-coding mitochondrial genes reveals signatures of positive selection on ATP synthase and cytochrome oxidase subunits, potentially linked to the metabolic demands of their extreme insular gigantism and a low-energy herbivorous diet.

"Antagonistic pleiotropy (AP), where a single allele confers both a beneficial and a detrimental effect, is a key mechanism maintaining genetic variation. We explored its role in a host-pathogen system using the bacterium *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and its lytic phage DMS3vir. We evolved bacterial populations under constant phage pressure and identified mutations conferring phage resistance. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that the majority of resistance mutations occurred in genes controlling pilus and flagellar biosynthesis. These mutations, while providing a strong selective advantage against predation, incurred a significant fitness cost in phage-free environments due to impaired motility and biofilm formation. Subsequent evolution in the absence of phages consistently led to the selection of second-site suppressor mutations rather than reversions, indicating that the pleiotropic costs are mediated by complex epistatic networks. Our results demonstrate how AP structures the genetic architecture of resistance and constrains evolutionary trajectories during coevolutionary arms races.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,The Evolutionary Dynamics of Antagonistic Pleiotropy in Host-Pathogen Coevolution
"Phenotypic plasticity allows organisms to produce different phenotypes in response to environmental cues, yet its genetic basis remains elusive. We investigated the genetic architecture of predator-induced plasticity in wood frog (*Lithobates sylvaticus*) tadpoles, which develop distinct morphologies in the presence versus absence of predators. Using a large-scale, multi-environment quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping experiment, we identified several genomic regions influencing morphological traits like tail depth and musculature. Crucially, we detected significant QTL-by-environment interactions, where allelic effects were contingent upon the presence of predator kairomones. One major QTL on chromosome 3, which exhibits a strong effect only in the predator-present environment, co-localizes with a cluster of genes involved in corticosteroid signaling pathways.

Our analysis revealed over 200 genes of prokaryotic origin integrated into the *L. luymesi* genome, an unprecedented number for a non-parasitic animal. Phylogenetic analyses and intron-position data confirm their transfer and subsequent functionalization within the host genome. These horizontally acquired genes are highly expressed in the trophosome—the symbiont-housing organ—and are enriched for functions in sulfide metabolism, carbon fixation, and amino acid synthesis. This suggests a massive transfer of metabolic capabilities from symbiont to host, effectively creating a chimeric metabolic network.

We tested this hypothesis using a comparative transcriptomic approach across the liver, brain, and skin tissues of 15 mammalian species with lifespans ranging from 2 to 200 years. After correcting for phylogenetic inertia, we identified a conserved suite of genes whose expression levels correlate significantly with maximum lifespan. Long-lived species consistently exhibited higher constitutive expression of genes involved in DNA repair, protein chaperoning (e.g., heat-shock proteins), and antioxidant defense pathways. Conversely, genes associated with inflammatory responses and cellular proliferation showed lower baseline expression in longer-lived species.

Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and RNA-seq on F3-generation hybrids reared in divergent ecological mimetic environments, we identified hundreds of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with shifts in nuptial coloration and courtship behavior. We demonstrate that a subset of these environmentally induced DMRs are heritably stable and correlate with significant changes in the expression of key developmental genes. Our models suggest that this epigenetic inheritance system creates a rapid pathway for phenotype-environment matching, which, when coupled with assortative mating, can establish pre-zygotic isolation on timescales far shorter than those required for fixation of genetic mutations.

By subjecting a large panel of recombinant inbred lines to acute thermal stress, we induced widespread decanalization of developmental pathways, revealing extensive heritable variation in survival and fecundity traits. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping combined with transcriptomic analysis identified several loci previously unassociated with thermotolerance, which were buffered under benign conditions by the molecular chaperone Hsp90.

Employing state-of-the-art codon-based models of sequence evolution that account for heterogeneous selective pressures across lineages (e.g., RELAX, BUSTED-PH), we identified statistically significant signals of convergent evolution in 37 genes, far exceeding neutral expectations. These genes are disproportionately involved in cochlear function, neuronal development, and collagen biosynthesis, including well-known examples like *Prestin* and *TMC1* and novel candidates like *OTOF* and *CABP2*.

Our phylogenetic analysis identified over 200 independent HGT events of bacterial genes involved in amino acid and vitamin biosynthesis into host genomes. Using flux balance analysis on reconstructed metabolic networks, we demonstrate that these horizontally acquired genes are not merely redundant but are fully integrated, often forming novel chimeric pathways that significantly increase metabolic efficiency and robustness.

By sequencing hundreds of genomes sampled over a decade, we tracked allele frequency trajectories across the entire genome. Our analysis revealed strong signatures of balancing selection at host Resistance (R) loci and pathogen Avirulence (Avr) loci, consistent with negative frequency-dependent selection. We identified rapid, alternating selective sweeps at linked genomic regions, indicating a coevolutionary arms race where novel R-gene specificities and corresponding pathogen effectors cyclically rise in frequency and are subsequently countered.

However, the cis-regulatory elements (CREs) controlling these genes have undergone extensive rewiring. We identified numerous gains and losses of transcription factor binding sites within enhancers, leading to heterochronic and heterotopic shifts in gene expression.

"Meiotic recombination is fundamental to sexual reproduction, yet the rapid evolution of its genomic localization remains enigmatic. We propose that this turnover is driven by an intragenomic conflict mediated by the histone methyltransferase PRDM9. This protein binds to specific DNA motifs to initiate recombination, but its binding sites are self-destructively eroded by biased gene conversion. Using population genomic data from diverse mammalian lineages, we show that PRDM9's DNA-binding domain is one of the fastest-evolving protein domains, undergoing constant selection to recognize new motifs. We model this as a coevolutionary arms race: PRDM9 must continually evolve to escape the 'hotspot paradox,' while the genome benefits from preventing recombination at selfish or deleterious loci. Our simulations demonstrate this conflict can drive both rapid hotspot turnover and contribute to hybrid sterility, thus acting as an unanticipated engine of speciation.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Intragenomic Conflict and the Evolution of Meiotic Recombination Hotspots in Mammals

Our analysis confirms multiple admixture events between Neanderthals, Denisovans, and anatomically modern humans. Critically, we identify previously undetected bidirectional gene flow, including introgression from an early modern human population into Eastern Neanderthals. We further demonstrate that introgressed haplotypes are non-randomly distributed in the human genome; regions associated with innate immunity (e.g., the TLR gene cluster) and metabolic adaptation to high-altitude environments (e.g., EPAS1) show strong signatures of positive selection.

We tracked the real-time evolution of high-level antibiotic resistance in *Escherichia coli* using a morbidostat device combined with ultra-deep sequencing. While initial resistance mutations followed a predictable, deterministic path up a local fitness peak, the transition to higher resistance required traversing a significant fitness valley. Contrary to classical models expecting sequential fixation, we observed that populations crossed this valley via 'stochastic tunneling,' where the double-mutant genotype arises in a single mutational step within the genetic background of a large population, bypassing the less-fit intermediate. Our results demonstrate that population size can fundamentally alter evolutionary dynamics on rugged landscapes, allowing stochastic events to circumvent deterministic constraints.

Using single-cell RNA-seq and fluorescent reporters, we demonstrate that the decision is governed by a bistable gene regulatory network characterized by a positive feedback loop involving the transcription factor *Msn2*. Stochastic bursts of *Msn2* expression can flip individual cells between two stable states: 'on' (quiescent) and 'off' (active growth).

This learned prior is then used to constrain the NMF decomposition of the historical recording's spectrogram, guiding the factorization to separate spectral bases corresponding to distinct instruments from those representing harmonic progressions. We demonstrate our method's efficacy on early 20th-century orchestral recordings, showing superior performance in both instrumental stem extraction and subsequent harmonic analysis compared to traditional NMF and deep learning-based separation models.

We define metrical dissonance as the normalized cross-correlation between energy distributions at conflicting metrical levels (e.g., duple vs. triple subdivisions) within a sliding time window. The resulting time-varying dissonance profile is validated against seminal works by composers like Stravinsky and Ligeti, known for their complex rhythmic structures.

By calculating rates of protein evolution (dN/dS) and performing McDonald-Kreitman tests across hundreds of candidate genes, we found overwhelming evidence for rapid, recurrent positive selection in both gene classes. Genes with the highest evolutionary rates were functionally implicated in sperm competition, cryptic female choice, and modulating female remating behavior. The congruent signatures of adaptive evolution in both male and female proteins strongly support a model of sexually antagonistic coevolution, where manipulative male SFPs drive the evolution of defensive female counter-adaptations in a perpetual coevolutionary chase, profoundly shaping the species' reproductive biology.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Accelerated Evolution of Seminal Fluid and Oviduct Proteins Driven by Intersexual Genomic Conflict
"Identifying intrinsic traits that predispose clades to extinction is a core goal of macroevolutionary research. We utilized a supertree of 1,500 marine bivalve genera spanning the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary and applied phylogenetic comparative methods to test for extinction selectivity. Our models reveal that the predictors of extinction risk were contingent on the specific environmental perturbation. During the initial phases dominated by impact-induced darkness and productivity collapse, genera with non-planktotrophic larval development and larger body sizes exhibited significantly higher extinction probabilities. However, in the subsequent phase characterized by ocean acidification, genera with aragonitic shell mineralogy experienced disproportionately higher extinction rates, irrespective of developmental mode. These results demonstrate that extinction selectivity is not a static property of a clade but is dynamically mediated by the nature of the environmental stressor. This finding complicates efforts to predict future biodiversity loss, suggesting that there is no universal 'extinction-proof' trait profile.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Contingent Selectivity: Trait-Dependent Extinction Risk During the Cretaceous-Paleogene Mass Extinction was Environmentally Mediated

We demonstrate that primordial non-Gaussianities, parameterized by the bispectrum f_NL, induce detectable corrections to the entanglement spectrum and enhance the long-range quantum correlations. Using a Bell-inequality-inspired correlation function constructed from CMB temperature and polarization data, we derive new constraints on local-type non-Gaussianity.

"Adaptive radiations are hallmarks of evolutionary innovation, yet the mechanisms governing their tempo and trajectory remain debated. We investigate the interplay between ecological opportunity and intrinsic lineage properties by simulating the radiation of African cichlids on complex, empirically derived fitness landscapes. Our agent-based model, which integrates functional morphology, resource competition, and phylogenetic constraints, demonstrates that radiations are highly contingent phenomena. While ecological opportunity is a prerequisite, the resulting phenotypic diversity is critically shaped by the initial state of key functional traits and the strength of eco-evolutionary feedbacks. We find that early-burst patterns of diversification are not universal, but rather emerge under specific conditions of strong competition and vacant niche space. The model predicts emergent properties, such as trophic guild structuring and punctuated equilibria, providing a mechanistic framework that reconciles the deterministic role of ecological selection with the stochastic nature of macroevolutionary history.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Eco-Evolutionary Feedbacks and the Contingent Nature of Adaptive Radiation in Cichlid Fishes
"The evolution of eusociality represents a major transition in individuality, predicated on the reproductive division of labor. The proximate mechanisms governing caste differentiation, a form of extreme polyphenism, are crucial to understanding this transition. We investigated the role of epigenetic modifications in the honeybee, Apis mellifera, by profiling histone acetylation landscapes in response to differential larval nutrition. Using ChIP-seq, we identified thousands of differentially acetylated regions between queen- and worker-destined larvae, particularly at enhancer elements flanking key developmental regulators like the TOR and insulin signaling pathways. Inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs) partially phenocopied a royal jelly diet, biasing development toward the queen trajectory. These results demonstrate that histone acetylation acts as a critical molecular integrator of environmental cues and the conserved genetic toolkit for development, providing a mechanistic basis for the evolutionary origin and maintenance of non-genetic caste determination in superorganisms.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Epigenetic Regulation of Caste Polyphenism: Histone Acetylation Underpins Trophic Signaling in Eusocial Hymenoptera
"The causal factors of Late Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions remain controversial, with debates centered on climate change versus anthropogenic pressures. We present a high-coverage paleogenome from a 30,000-year-old steppe bison (Bison priscus) vertebra and compare it with 50 newly sequenced mitochondrial genomes spanning the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Our analyses, utilizing pairwise sequentially Markovian coalescent (PSMC) modeling, reveal a long-term decline in effective population size beginning well before significant human presence. We further uncover compelling evidence of ancient admixture with an ancestral American bison lineage, suggesting periodic connectivity across Beringia. Despite this introgression, genomic metrics of heterozygosity and runs of homozygosity indicate a sharp decline in genetic diversity immediately preceding the LGM, which likely compromised the species' adaptive potential. These findings suggest that protracted climatic shifts were the primary driver of this megafauna's demographic trajectory, with a terminal loss of genetic variation creating a prelude to extinction.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Paleogenomic Reconstruction of Late Pleistocene Megafaunal Dynamics Reveals Admixture and Declining Genetic Diversity Prior to Extinction
"Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is a paramount force in prokaryotic evolution, yet its role in constructing complex metabolic pathways remains poorly quantified. Here, we analyze the pangenome of 150 species from the archaeal phylum Crenarchaeota, focusing on the acquisition of pathways for chemoautotrophy in hyperthermophilic environments. By constructing phylogenetically incongruent gene trees and mapping their distribution onto the species phylogeny, we demonstrate that the entire sulfur-reducing metabolic module has been assembled through a mosaic of HGT events, predominantly mediated by plasmids and integrative conjugative elements constituting the mobilome. We identify 'hotspots' of integration within chromosomes, flanking tRNA genes. Our network-based analysis shows that acquired genes are rapidly integrated into existing regulatory circuits. This study illustrates that HGT is not merely a source of individual traits but a fundamental mechanism for the modular assembly and evolutionary innovation of entire metabolic networks, enabling rapid adaptation to extreme environments.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Pangenome Dynamics and the Mobilome-Mediated Evolution of Metabolic Novelty in Hyperthermophilic Archaea
"Sexually antagonistic coevolution, arising from interlocus sexual conflict, is hypothesized to be a potent engine of rapid molecular evolution and reproductive isolation. We test this hypothesis by conducting population genomic analyses on 30 species of Drosophila, focusing on seminal fluid proteins (SFPs) and their female reproductive tract interactors. Using codon-based models (dN/dS), we identify pervasive and recurrent positive selection acting on SFP genes, a pattern significantly stronger than in non-reproductive proteins. Furthermore, the rate of adaptive evolution in SFPs is positively correlated with the degree of polyandry, a proxy for the intensity of sexual conflict. We demonstrate that specific rapidly evolving male SFPs and female receptors show signatures of coevolutionary arms races. Crucially, lineages with higher rates of SFP evolution also exhibit accelerated rates of speciation, providing strong evidence that sexual conflict is a key driver of both molecular divergence and the evolution of reproductive isolation barriers.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Signatures of Interlocus Sexual Conflict Drive Rapid Evolution of Seminal Fluid Proteins and Speciation in Drosophila
"Classic evolutionary theories of senescence, such as antagonistic pleiotropy, provide an ultimate explanation for aging but often lack mechanistic grounding. We developed a state-dependent life-history model that explicitly integrates the molecular biology of cellular aging with evolutionary trade-offs. In our model, allocation of resources to somatic maintenance directly influences the rate of telomere attrition, while allocation to reproduction yields immediate fitness benefits but at the cost of accelerated senescence via pleiotropic pathways. The model predicts an optimal allocation strategy that results in a declining force of natural selection with age, leading to the evolution of aging as an emergent property. It successfully recapitulates empirical patterns, including the negative correlation between extrinsic mortality and lifespan, and makes novel predictions about the coevolution of telomerase activity and reproductive scheduling. This synthesis provides a powerful framework for understanding how ultimate evolutionary pressures shape the proximate molecular mechanisms of senescence.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,The Evolutionary Theory of Senescence Revisited: A Mechanistic Model Integrating Antagonistic Pleiotropy and Telomere Attrition
"The vast diversity of life is structured by both adaptation and constraint, yet the role of developmental systems in shaping macroevolutionary trajectories is incompletely understood. We investigated the evolution of the tetrapod limb, a classic example of serial homology and adaptive diversification, using a comparative framework combining 3D geometric morphometrics and phylogenetic analysis of key developmental gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Our results demonstrate that while the limb has adapted to numerous functions, its evolution has been restricted to a limited volume of theoretical morphospace. We show that this constraint is correlated with the deep conservation of the core limb-patterning GRN, including key transcription factors like Shh and HoxD cluster genes. This network architecture promotes canalization, buffering development against perturbation and thereby limiting phenotypic variance. We argue that while plasticity allows for adaptive modification, the inherent canalization of the underlying developmental architecture acts as a powerful macroevolutionary constraint, channeling evolutionary pathways.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Developmental Canalization as a Macroevolutionary Constraint: Evolvability and the Occupation of Morphospace in Tetrapod Limbs
"Host-parasite interactions are often characterized by antagonistic coevolution, described by the Red Queen hypothesis. At the molecular level, this should manifest as rapid, recurrent positive selection on genes mediating the interaction. We tested this prediction using the interaction between Arabidopsis thaliana and the pathogenic oomycete Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis. We sequenced and analyzed a suite of nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) immune receptor genes from diverse A. thaliana ecotypes and corresponding effector genes (RxLR proteins) from pathogen isolates. Likelihood ratio tests for positive selection revealed exceptionally high dN/dS ratios in specific domains responsible for pathogen recognition—the LRR domain in NLRs and the C-terminal region of RxLR effectors. Furthermore, we identified a significant spatial clustering of positively selected sites at the predicted protein-protein interaction interface. This tit-for-tat molecular evolution provides a textbook example of a Red Queen dynamic, illustrating the intense selective pressures that drive the diversification of host immune systems and pathogen virulence factors.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Molecular Signatures of a Coevolutionary Arms Race: Recurrent Positive Selection in Plant NLR Receptors and Fungal Effectors
"The transition from unicellular to multicellular life is one of the major transitions in individuality, requiring the evolution of cell differentiation, cooperation, and a division of labor between germline and somatic cells. We utilized the volvocine algae, a lineage spanning from unicellular Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to multicellular Volvox carteri with a sterile soma, as a model system to dissect this transition. Using comparative transcriptomics and network inference algorithms, we reconstructed and compared the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) governing the cell cycle and developmental programs. Our analysis reveals that the evolution of multicellularity and germ-soma differentiation was not driven by the evolution of many new genes, but rather by the extensive rewiring of ancestral GRNs. Specifically, we identified the co-option of conserved cell-cycle regulators, such as the retinoblastoma protein, into a novel developmental checkpoint that orchestrates somatic cell differentiation in Volvox. This demonstrates how redeployment and modification of existing genetic architecture can precipitate a major evolutionary transition.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Gene Regulatory Network Rewiring and the Major Transition to Multicellularity in the Volvocine Algae
"This paper introduces a novel framework integrating proximal causal inference with debiased machine learning to estimate average treatment effects in high-dimensional settings plagued by unobserved confounding. Our method leverages orthogonal moment functions to construct a multiply robust estimator that maintains consistency and asymptotic normality, provided valid instrumental variables are available. By employing a cross-fitting procedure, the estimator mitigates regularization-induced bias, allowing for the use of flexible machine learning algorithms (e.g., random forests, gradient boosting) to model the nuisance functions—namely the propensity score, outcome regression, and instrument-treatment relationship. We establish rigorous theoretical guarantees for our proximal doubly robust lasso (PDRL) estimator under weaker sparsity assumptions than competing methods. The estimator demonstrates superior finite-sample performance in simulation studies, particularly under severe model misspecification and high-dimensional covariate spaces. We illustrate its practical utility by applying it to a large-scale genomic dataset to identify causal genetic variants influencing complex traits, controlling for latent population structure.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,Debiased Machine Learning for High-Dimensional Causal Inference with Latent Confounders
"We develop a scalable variational inference algorithm for Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) mixture models where the stick-breaking proportions are modulated by external covariates. This extension facilitates the principled discovery of latent group structures that evolve as a function of observed variables, moving beyond the static clustering assumption of traditional HDPs. We derive a novel mean-field variational objective function and closed-form coordinate ascent updates for the variational parameters, circumventing the computational intractability of MCMC-based approaches in massive datasets. The model’s key innovation lies in parameterizing the concentration parameters of the beta distributions in the stick-breaking construction as a log-linear function of covariates. We demonstrate the model's efficacy in topic modeling for longitudinal corpora and in clustering high-dimensional single-cell RNA-seq data across different experimental conditions, showing improved predictive likelihood and enhanced interpretability over standard HDP implementations. Asymptotic properties and convergence guarantees of the proposed algorithm are also formally established.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,Variational Inference for Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Mixture Models with Covariate-Dependent Stick-Breaking
"This work presents a rigorous framework for statistical inference on populations of persistence diagrams, the primary output of topological data analysis. By treating persistence diagrams as elements of a metric space endowed with the p-Wasserstein distance, we define a population Fréchet mean and propose a consistent empirical estimator. The principal contribution is the development of a multiplier bootstrap procedure for constructing confidence regions for this non-Euclidean mean. This method is computationally efficient and avoids the combinatorial complexity of permutation tests while providing strong theoretical guarantees on asymptotic coverage probability under mild regularity conditions on the underlying data-generating process. We establish the consistency and convergence rates of the bootstrap procedure. The utility of our inferential tools is illustrated through applications in discriminating morphological classes of neurons and analyzing shape variability in protein structures, where our method demonstrates enhanced statistical power to detect subtle geometric differences compared to existing summary-statistic-based approaches.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,Statistical Inference on Persistence Diagrams using Fréchet Means in Wasserstein Space
"We introduce a novel dynamic spatio-temporal factor model for high-dimensional data exhibiting non-stationary spatial and temporal dependencies. The framework models latent factors as evolving according to a vector autoregressive process, while the factor loadings are endowed with non-stationary Gaussian process priors. This non-stationarity is achieved by parameterizing the hyperparameters of a Matérn covariance kernel, such as length-scale and marginal variance, as functions of spatial coordinates. This allows the model to capture varying degrees of spatial smoothness and correlation across the domain flexibly. Inference is performed within a fully Bayesian framework using an efficient MCMC algorithm that synergistically combines a Kalman filter for the temporal dynamics with a Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) for the spatially-varying kernel parameters. The proposed methodology offers a parsimonious yet powerful approach to modeling complex dependencies, and we validate its superior predictive performance on both synthetic data and a real-world application involving satellite-derived climate data.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Factor Models with Non-Stationary Gaussian Process Priors
"This paper proposes an adaptive Huber regularization method for robust parameter estimation in high-dimensional linear models where noise is drawn from heavy-tailed and possibly asymmetric distributions. Unlike standard robust methods that rely on a pre-specified, fixed robustness parameter, our approach simultaneously estimates the regression coefficients and the optimal Huber parameter by penalizing a data-driven quantile of the squared residuals. This adaptive procedure circumvents the need for computationally intensive cross-validation and provides robust estimates against a wider class of error distributions without sacrificing efficiency under Gaussianity. We establish non-asymptotic oracle inequalities for the proposed estimator, demonstrating that it achieves near-optimal statistical convergence rates under standard assumptions on the design matrix. The algorithm is based on a computationally efficient majorization-minimization (MM) principle.

The estimation is formulated within a mixed-effects model, which naturally accommodates irregular observation schedules and measurement error. A key innovation is the integration of an L1 penalty on the principal component scores, which induces sparsity and facilitates interpretable variable selection when linking functional patterns to high-dimensional covariates. We develop an efficient iterative algorithm based on a conditional expectation maximization scheme to solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem. Asymptotic consistency and convergence rates for the estimated eigenfunctions and scores are established under mild conditions, and the method's practical utility is demonstrated by analyzing sparse longitudinal biomarker data from a clinical trial.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,Sparse Functional Principal Component Analysis for Irregularly Sampled Longitudinal Data

Our approach operates on a regularized complex adjacency matrix, leveraging its leading eigenvectors to perform clustering. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis grounded in matrix perturbation theory, establishing sharp, non-asymptotic conditions for consistent community recovery. These conditions explicitly depend on the signal-to-noise ratio, community sizes, and the asymmetry of the underlying connectivity probability matrix. The algorithm is computationally efficient, with a complexity that scales linearly with the number of edges. Through comprehensive simulations, we demonstrate that Di-Spec significantly outperforms extant methods on sparse, directed, and weighted graphs. An application to a neural connectivity network reveals functionally distinct circuits that were previously obscured by methods designed for undirected graphs.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,Spectral Methods for Community Detection in Directed and Weighted Stochastic Block Models
"Standard doubly robust estimators for the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) achieve root-n consistency if either the propensity score or outcome regression model is correctly specified and estimated at a sufficient rate. However, when both nuisance models are estimated with flexible machine learning algorithms, these rates may not be met, leading to biased inference. This paper introduces a new class of estimators based on higher-order influence functions derived from third-order U-statistics. Our proposed estimator is multiply robust, remaining consistent under weaker conditions, and exhibits a faster convergence rate for its second-order remainder term. This property facilitates valid inference even when nuisance estimators converge at slower, nonparametric rates. We utilize a multi-way cross-fitting scheme to eliminate bias from overfitting and establish the asymptotic normality of our estimator under minimal assumptions. Simulation studies show our estimator provides more reliable confidence intervals and lower bias than traditional doubly robust methods when using complex learners like neural networks or random forests.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,Higher-Order Influence Functions for Doubly Robust Causal Effect Estimation
"The knockoff filter is a powerful framework for controlling the False Discovery Rate (FDR) in high-dimensional variable selection. However, the canonical construction of knockoff variables often ignores known structural dependencies among covariates, such as those encoded by a graph. This paper introduces the Graph-Constrained Knockoff (GCK) filter, a novel method for generating knockoff variables that precisely preserve the conditional independence structure of the original covariates, as specified by an underlying Gaussian Graphical Model. By constructing knockoffs that are conditionally independent of their corresponding original variables given all other variables, GCK decouples statistical power from the conditioning of the design matrix. This leads to substantial gains in power when covariates are highly correlated. We provide a rigorous proof that GCK controls the exact FDR in finite samples. The construction leverages efficient sampling from Gaussian conditional distributions. We demonstrate through simulations and a gene regulatory network analysis that GCK provides significant power improvements over existing knockoff methods.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,The Graph-Constrained Knockoff Filter for FDR Control in Structured Hypothesis Testing
"We develop a geometric Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework for efficient posterior inference in complex Bayesian models with parameter constraints, such as positivity, simplex, or correlation matrix constraints. Standard Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is inefficient in such settings due to proposal rejections at boundaries and poor exploration of complex posterior geometries. Our method, Riemannian Manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (RMHMC), formulates the sampling problem on a Riemannian manifold where the metric tensor is informed by the local geometry of the parameter space, typically using the Fisher-Rao information metric. This allows the Hamiltonian dynamics to adapt to the posterior curvature, generating distant proposals with high acceptance rates while naturally respecting constraints. We derive the geodesic flow equations for several common constraint manifolds and develop a numerically stable, generalized leapfrog integrator.

"The precise spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression is paramount for neuronal differentiation. While protein factors are well-studied, the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as epigenetic regulators in this process remains nascent. We have identified NeuroSil, a previously uncharacterized lncRNA specifically expressed in neuronal progenitor cells. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), we demonstrate that NeuroSil acts as a molecular scaffold, directly binding the EZH2 subunit of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and guiding it to a specific cohort of protocadherin gene clusters. This targeted recruitment results in localized H3K27 trimethylation and transcriptional repression. CRISPR interference-mediated knockdown of NeuroSil in human embryonic stem cell-derived cortical organoids leads to precocious expression of synaptic genes, impaired neuronal migration, and aberrant network formation.

We propose a model wherein pioneer transcription factors initiate the formation of biomolecular condensates via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). We demonstrate that the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of FOXA1 is essential for its phase separation in vitro and in vivo. High-resolution live-cell imaging and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) reveal that FOXA1 forms liquid-like droplets at super-enhancers, which co-localize with MED1 and BRD4. Mutations within the FOXA1 IDR that disrupt LLPS abrogate the formation of these transcriptional hubs, diminish enhancer-promoter looping as measured by Hi-C, and attenuate target gene expression.

"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant internal modification on eukaryotic mRNA, dynamically regulating mRNA fate. Its role in the nervous system is emerging. Here, we investigate the epitranscriptomic control of activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc), a master regulator of synaptic plasticity. Using MeRIP-seq in primary hippocampal neurons, we identify a conserved m6A site within the 3' UTR of Arc mRNA. Following induction of long-term potentiation (LTP), this site undergoes rapid demethylation by FTO, stabilizing the transcript. Conversely, under basal conditions, the m6A reader protein YTHDF2 binds to the methylated Arc mRNA, recruiting the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex to trigger its decay. Genetic ablation or shRNA-mediated knockdown of YTHDF2 results in elevated basal Arc levels, impaired m6A-dependent degradation, and deficits in long-term depression (LTD).

Bioinformatic analysis revealed a significant enrichment for upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the 5' leaders of these upregulated transcripts. This translational induction is dependent on the GCN2-eIF2α phosphorylation axis of the integrated stress response.

Upon proteotoxic stress, RNF190 is recruited to protein inclusions where it deposits non-degradative K63-linked polyubiquitin chains. We show through co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro binding assays that the WD40 domain of the core autophagy protein ATG16L1 directly recognizes these K63 chains, bypassing the need for canonical LIR-containing receptors like p62. Depletion of RNF190 or mutation of the ATG16L1 ubiquitin-binding interface severely impairs clearance of polyglutamine aggregates and sensitizes cells to proteotoxicity.

Using DRIP-seq and immunofluorescence, we show these R-loops co-localize with components of the ATR signaling pathway and are hotspots for recombination factor recruitment. Overexpression of RNase H1, which resolves R-loops, or knockdown of TERRA leads to diminished ATR activation, reduced ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs), and an increase in telomeric C-circles, a marker of telomere instability.

The decoder then synthesizes data by propagating these variables through the learned causal graph. We demonstrate that this architecture not only achieves superior disentanglement scores on benchmark datasets but also enables targeted interventions and the generation of valid counterfactuals by manipulating specific latent variables.

To thwart malicious encrypted inputs, we introduce a zero-knowledge verifiable computation scheme that allows clients to prove the correctness of their encrypted updates with respect to a predefined constraint set. Furthermore, VEAP employs an adaptive differential privacy mechanism that calibrates the noise level based on the estimated number of malicious participants, optimizing the privacy-utility trade-off. Theoretical analysis and extensive empirical evaluations on non-IID datasets confirm that VEAP significantly outperforms existing robust FL methods under strong adversarial settings.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Byzantine-Resilient Federated Learning with Verifiable Homomorphic Encryption and Adaptive Differential Privacy
"The quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism in Transformer models presents a formidable computational bottleneck for processing ultra-long sequences. This work introduces a novel attention mechanism, Factorized Kernel Attention (FKA), that achieves linear complexity with respect to sequence length while maintaining high model performance. FKA approximates the softmax attention matrix by projecting the query and key vectors into a lower-dimensional randomized feature space, effectively reformulating the attention computation as a kernel function. Through a factorized projection strategy, we obviate the need to explicitly instantiate the full attention matrix, reducing the complexity from O(N^2) to O(N). Unlike previous approximation methods that exhibit performance degradation, FKA leverages properties of positive semi-definite kernels to ensure a stable and expressive approximation. We demonstrate that FKA-equipped Transformers achieve state-of-the-art results on long-document summarization, genomics, and time-series forecasting benchmarks, enabling models to process sequences of unprecedented length.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Sub-Quadratic Attention via Factorized Kernel Projections for Ultra-Long Sequence Modeling
"Existing meta-learning algorithms for few-shot classification often yield point estimates of task-specific parameters, failing to capture epistemic uncertainty crucial for risk-sensitive applications. We propose a novel Bayesian meta-learning framework, Hypernetwork-Amortized Variational Inference (HAVI), that learns a posterior distribution over model parameters for novel tasks. HAVI employs a hypernetwork to generate the parameters of a variational distribution, conditioned on a task's support set. This amortizes the cost of posterior inference, allowing for rapid adaptation and uncertainty estimation at meta-test time. By marginalizing over the approximate posterior, our model produces robust predictions and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. We demonstrate that HAVI significantly outperforms prior methods, including MAML and Prototypical Networks, on challenging few-shot classification benchmarks, particularly in out-of-distribution detection and active learning scenarios, where reliable uncertainty quantification is paramount.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Bayesian Meta-Learning with Hypernetwork-Amortized Variational Inference for Few-Shot Uncertainty Quantification
"We present a unified framework for learning joint representations across disparate modalities, such as vision, language, and audio, without requiring explicit cross-modal paired data for all combinations. Our approach, termed Multimodal Contrastive Alignment (MCA), leverages a contrastive learning objective to project modality-specific encoders onto a shared semantic manifold. The key innovation is a cyclical consistency loss that enforces transitive relations across modalities; for instance, if an image is aligned with a text caption, and that caption is aligned with an audio clip, the framework encourages the direct alignment of the image and audio representations. This enables zero-shot cross-modal retrieval and classification between modalities that were never observed together during training. We validate MCA on large-scale multimodal datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot image-to-audio retrieval and text-based video search, showcasing the framework's ability to create a highly coherent and versatile joint embedding space.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Unified Multimodal Representation Learning through Cross-Modal Contrastive Alignment in a Shared Semantic Manifold
"We introduce a novel method for generating concept-based counterfactual explanations for complex black-box models. Existing counterfactual explanation methods often produce changes at the pixel level, which lack semantic interpretability. Our framework first learns a set of disentangled high-level concepts from the data distribution using a GAN-based architecture. Subsequently, given a specific prediction to be explained, we identify the minimal perturbation along these concept axes in the GAN's latent space that alters the model's output. This manipulation produces a new, synthetic instance—a counterfactual—that is perceptually realistic and differs from the original instance only by a well-defined, human-understandable concept (e.g., 'add glasses' or 'increase age'). We formalize this as a constrained optimization problem in the disentangled latent space. Our user studies and quantitative evaluations confirm that concept-driven counterfactuals provide more actionable and interpretable insights into model behavior than state-of-the-art pixel-based and feature-attribution methods.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Concept-Driven Counterfactuals: Generating Semantic Explanations via Latent Space Perturbation in Generative Models
"Adaptive gradient methods such as Adam are ubiquitous in deep learning, yet their generalization properties remain poorly understood compared to stochastic gradient descent (SGD). This paper investigates the implicit regularization induced by adaptive optimizers from the perspective of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). By analyzing the continuous-time limit of Adam in over-parameterized linear and non-linear models, we demonstrate that the adaptive preconditioning introduces a non-uniform, state-dependent regularization. This effect biases the solution towards parameters with flatter loss landscapes but smaller gradient-to-parameter ratios, contrasting with the uniform implicit bias of SGD. Our analysis reveals that this can lead to poorer generalization in certain network architectures where sparse solutions are optimal. We provide a rigorous theoretical framework that characterizes the convergence trajectory and solution bias, corroborating our findings with empirical results on both synthetic data and deep neural networks, thus illuminating the trade-offs inherent in adaptive optimization.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,On the Implicit Regularization of Adaptive Optimizers: A Stochastic Differential Equation Perspective on Generalization in Over-Parameterized Regimes

Our model, SymGAN, is a conditional generative adversarial network that synthesizes stable crystal structures, represented by atomic coordinates and lattice vectors, conditioned on a target property vector (e.g., band gap, formation energy). A key innovation is the integration of a differentiable symmetry loss function that explicitly penalizes violations of crystallographic symmetry groups, acting as a strong physical prior that guides the generator towards physically plausible and stable structures. The generator is trained adversarially against a discriminator that learns the manifold of known materials from databases like the Materials Project. By sampling from SymGAN with a desired property input, we can rapidly generate novel, diverse, and synthesizable candidate materials. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by discovering several novel structures with targeted electronic properties, subsequently validated using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Inverse Design of Crystalline Materials using Property-Conditioned Generative Adversarial Networks with a Differentiable Symmetry Constraint

By employing a third-quantization formalism and Keldysh field theory, we analytically derive the Liouvillian spectrum, revealing the emergence of exceptional points that precede the topological phase transition. Our analysis demonstrates that environmental coupling induces a non-trivial renormalization of the Majorana fermion velocity and a finite lifetime for the emergent Z2 gauge field fluxes. We find that while generic dissipation suppresses topological entanglement entropy, engineered Markovian baths can stabilize the non-Abelian anyonic excitations against local perturbations. Crucially, our results show that the braiding statistics of the Majorana zero modes remain robust up to a critical dissipation strength, beyond which the system transitions into a topologically trivial, decohered paramagnet. These findings provide a theoretical framework for understanding the stability of topological quantum computation platforms under realistic open-system conditions.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Kuantum,Generated,Decoherence and Entanglement Dynamics in a Non-Hermitian Kitaev Honeycomb Model

Extending the Ryu-Takayanagi and Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi prescriptions, we formulate a novel entanglement-based inverse problem for reconstructing the bulk metric. By utilizing the concept of entanglement of purification and the associated causal shadow, we demonstrate that the quantum error correction properties of the AdS/CFT correspondence allow for the reconstruction of bulk operators within the entanglement wedge, even when they lie outside the causal wedge of the boundary region. We introduce a differential entropy metric on the space of boundary subregions and show that its geometric properties are dual to the Ricci scalar curvature of the bulk.

Utilizing large-scale exact diagonalization and a time-evolution block decimation (TEBD) algorithm adapted for Floquet operators, we map the complete phase diagram as a function of driving frequency and disorder strength. The transition is characterized by a sharp change in the level spacing statistics of the Floquet quasienergies, from Poissonian to Wigner-Dyson distribution. We analyze the multifractal scaling of the Floax (Floquet-Bloch) eigenstates, revealing a non-ergodic but delocalized phase intermediate between the fully localized and thermal regimes. Furthermore, our analysis of entanglement entropy growth shows a sustained logarithmic increase in the MBL phase, contrasted with a diffusive ballistic growth post-transition, consistent with the predictions for heating in generic Floquet systems.

The simulations are performed on a 64³×16 lattice using a domain wall fermion formulation to preserve chiral symmetry, at a physical pion mass and a temperature of T ≈ 250 MeV. By applying a background magnetic field, we measure the vector current response parallel to the field, which is directly proportional to the CME conductivity. The calculation requires a meticulous subtraction of lattice artifacts arising from the explicit breaking of rotational symmetry, which is achieved through a novel momentum-space subtraction scheme. Our final result for the CME conductivity is significantly smaller than prior holographic and model-based estimates but non-zero, providing a crucial quantitative benchmark for phenomenological models used to interpret charge-dependent correlations in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Kuantum,Generated,Lattice QCD Calculation of the Chiral Magnetic Effect from First Principles

A squeezed vacuum field is injected into the trapping optical tweezers, generating a two-mode squeezed state of the nanoparticle phononic modes. The differential displacement induced by a gravitational gradient imprints a phase on this entangled state. We show that a subsequent homodyne measurement protocol allows for an estimation of the gradient with a sensitivity scaling that approaches the Heisenberg limit. The quantum Fisher information for this system is calculated, demonstrating a significant enhancement over classical and non-entangled quantum strategies.

We challenge this paradigm by introducing a theoretical framework for nonlocality in quantum networks with correlated sources. We derive a new class of multipartite Bell-type inequalities for a triangle network topology where the central source exhibits controlled correlations with the peripheral sources. Using the inflation technique, we demonstrate that quantum mechanics predicts violations of these inequalities that are impossible for any classical theory, even those allowing arbitrary classical communication between the sources (i.e., beyond local hidden variables). We experimentally verify these predictions using a programmable silicon-photonic integrated circuit that routes entangled photon pairs generated from spontaneous four-wave mixing.

Through extensive numerical simulations, we identify a non-equilibrium phase transition from a static, symmetric state to a dynamical phase characterized by a persistent, uni-directional flow of the condensate, forming a stable vortex. We analyze this transition using the formalism of large-deviation theory, linking the onset of chirality to a symmetry-breaking bifurcation in the trajectory of the system in phase space. The Liouvillian spectral gap is shown to close at the transition point.

This construction yields a code family with asymptotically good parameters, namely a finite encoding rate and a distance that scales at least as the square root of the block size, n. We analyze the performance of these codes under depolarizing noise using a belief propagation plus ordered statistics decoder (BP-OSD). Our large-scale Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate a fault-tolerance threshold of approximately 0.8%, which is significantly higher than that of the surface code under an equivalent decoding scheme. The decoder complexity scales polynomially with n, making it practical for near-term implementation. The reduced qubit overhead and high threshold of Lifted Product codes present a compelling alternative to topological codes for building a scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computer.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Kuantum,Generated,High-Threshold Quantum Error Correction with Lifted Product Codes

The device architecture allows for the deterministic trapping of a single quasiparticle excitation within the interferometer loop. By measuring the Aharonov-Bohm interference phase as a function of both magnetic field and gate-defined interferometer area, we observe discrete phase jumps of π. This is in stark contrast to the continuous phase evolution observed for Abelian anyons at ν=7/3. This π phase jump upon enclosing a bulk quasiparticle is a direct signature of the non-Abelian fusion rules of Ising anyons (Majorana zero modes) and provides the first definitive, transport-based confirmation of the topological order of the Moore-Read Pfaffian state.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Kuantum,Generated,Direct Observation of Non-Abelian Anyonic Statistics at the ν=5/2 Fractional Quantum Hall Plateau

By employing a resource-theoretic framework for quantum thermodynamics, we derive a fundamental inequality that bounds the rate of distillable entanglement generation by the system's total entropy production rate. This trade-off demonstrates that creating quantum correlations is an inherently irreversible process with an associated thermodynamic cost. The bound is shown to be tight for certain classes of driven-dissipative dynamics.

Our proof employs a sophisticated application of the flag algebra calculus, which reduces the asymptotic problem to a semidefinite programming instance. Furthermore, we analyze the stability of near-extremal constructions by leveraging a novel connection to the spectral radius of the hypergraph adjacency tensor. We demonstrate that any F-free 3-uniform hypergraph with an edge density approaching 4/9 must, in the edit distance sense, be close to a specific blow-up of a 3-vertex hypergraph.

Our main result provides an explicit upper bound, showing that for any F with n vertices, the Ramsey degree T(F) is at most 2^(n-1). The proof methodology integrates techniques from topological dynamics, specifically analyzing the universal minimal flow of the automorphism group of H_k, with a novel structural amalgamation argument for pre-colored finite graphs.

We combine algebraic constructions using difference methods over finite fields with exhaustive computational search to prove that a pentagonal STS(v) exists if and only if v ≡ 1, 5 (mod 30).

MALIGN-1 expression is highly correlated with poor patient prognosis and MYC amplification status. Using integrated genomic approaches, including Hi-C and Capture-C, we demonstrate that MALIGN-1 functions as a molecular scaffold. It simultaneously binds the chromatin architectural protein CTCF and the histone methyltransferase MLL1, tethering a distal enhancer element to the MYC promoter. This lncRNA-mediated chromatin looping event establishes a permissive chromatin state, characterized by elevated H3K4me3 and H3K27ac marks, leading to robust MYC transcription. Antisense oligonucleotide-mediated knockdown of MALIGN-1 in patient-derived xenograft models dismantled this chromatin architecture, abrogated MYC expression, and induced profound tumor regression.

"Translational control is a rapid and potent mechanism for cellular adaptation to stress. While the concept of 'specialized ribosomes' has been proposed, the molecular mechanisms governing their assembly and function are poorly defined.

Using ribosome profiling and quantitative mass spectrometry, we show that phosphorylated RACK1 (p-RACK1) is preferentially incorporated into a subpopulation of ribosomes. These 'hypoxia-specialized' ribosomes exhibit altered translational fidelity and enhanced affinity for mRNAs containing a distinct 5' terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) motif, including transcripts encoding key glycolytic enzymes and HIF-1α. Cryo-EM analysis of p-RACK1-containing ribosomes reveals a conformational shift in the mRNA entry channel that likely mediates this translational preference.

These FUS-SWI/SNF condensates are enriched in enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) and the Mediator complex. Using live-cell single-particle tracking and super-resolution microscopy, we show that these condensates act as dynamic hubs that physically bridge enhancers and their cognate gene promoters. The intrinsically disordered low-complexity domain of FUS is essential for phase separation, and ALS-associated mutations within this domain disrupt condensate formation and abrogate enhancer-promoter communication.

Using time-resolved cryo-EM, we captured snapshots of FAN1 engaged with a stalled replication fork mimic containing an ICL. The structures reveal how the monoubiquitinated FANCD2-FANCI clamp acts as a loading platform, recruiting FAN1 via its UBZ domain and positioning its catalytic domain precisely at the 5' flank of the ICL adduct.

"Mitochondrial quality control via mitophagy is critical for neuronal health, and its failure is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). The E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin and the deubiquitinase USP30 act antagonistically to regulate this process. Here, we uncover a pathogenic feedback loop centered on this axis. We demonstrate that Parkin not only ubiquitinates mitochondrial outer membrane proteins to initiate mitophagy but also directly monoubiquitinates USP30, targeting it for p97-dependent extraction from the mitochondrial membrane and subsequent degradation. This action creates a positive feedback loop that amplifies the mitophagy signal. We identified a cohort of PD patients with mutations in the Parkin-binding domain of USP30 that render it resistant to this regulation. In patient-derived dopaminergic neurons, these mutant USP30 variants are hyper-stable at the mitochondria, leading to excessive deubiquitination of mitophagic substrates and a profound defect in mitochondrial clearance.

"The therapeutic potential of CRISPR-based gene editing is hampered by challenges in safe and efficient in vivo delivery. Here, we report the development of an integrin-targeted lipid nanoparticle (LNP) platform for non-viral delivery of a cytosine base editor (CBE) mRNA and a chemically modified sgRNA. The LNP surface is functionalized with a cyclic RGD peptide ligand that targets αvβ5 integrins, which are highly expressed on lung airway epithelia. Following intravenous administration in a murine model of cystic fibrosis (CF) harboring the G542X nonsense mutation, these LNPs accumulate preferentially in the lung. We achieve up to 40% C-to-T base editing in airway epithelial cells, successfully converting the premature stop codon into a cysteine codon (CGA) and restoring CFTR protein function, as evidenced by normalized transepithelial chloride conductance. The platform demonstrates minimal off-target editing and a low immunogenic profile compared to AAV-based delivery systems.

"Cellular differentiation requires precise spatiotemporal modulation of the epigenetic landscape to establish lineage-specific gene expression programs. While the role of DNA methylation in silencing pluripotency genes is well-established, the mechanisms driving active demethylation at lineage-specific regulatory elements remain elusive. Combining genome-wide bisulfite sequencing with chromatin immunoprecipitation in a model of human hematopoietic stem cell differentiation, we show that the commitment to the erythroid lineage is preceded by targeted demethylation of a specific subset of enhancers. We demonstrate that the pioneering transcription factor GATA1 directly recruits the Ten-Eleven Translocation 2 (TET2) enzyme to these GATA1-binding motifs. This interaction facilitates iterative oxidation of 5-methylcytosine, leading to enhancer activation and subsequent expression of key erythroid genes like β-globin. Disruption of the GATA1-TET2 interaction abrogates enhancer demethylation and blocks erythroid differentiation. Our findings elucidate a direct mechanism for transcription factor-guided active demethylation, providing a paradigm for how cell fate decisions are epigenetically encoded.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,TET2-Mediated Demethylation of Lineage-Specific Enhancers is Directed by GATA1 during Erythroid Differentiation
"The hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein Tau are pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Molecular chaperones play a critical role in maintaining proteostasis, but their specific involvement with Tau remains contested. Here, we demonstrate that the Hsp90 chaperone system directly regulates Tau pathology by controlling the activity of its primary kinase, GSK-3β. Using a combination of NMR spectroscopy, single-molecule FRET, and cellular assays, we show that Tau exists in a dynamic equilibrium between a closed, aggregation-resistant conformation and an open, aggregation-prone state. The Hsp90/Cdc37 co-chaperone complex preferentially binds and stabilizes the inactive conformation of GSK-3β, thereby reducing Tau phosphorylation. Conversely, inhibition of Hsp90 releases active GSK-3β, leading to Tau hyperphosphorylation and a conformational shift towards the aggregation-prone state. This work reveals that Hsp90 acts as a critical regulator of the Tau phosphoproteome, not by directly binding Tau, but by conformationally gating its upstream kinase, offering new therapeutic avenues for tauopathies.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Conformational Gating of the Hsp90 Chaperone Cycle Modulates Tau Phosphorylation State and Aggregation Propensity
"We address the critical challenge of estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in observational studies. This paper introduces a novel Bayesian nonparametric framework based on a hierarchical Dirichlet process mixture model to flexibly estimate the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE). The proposed model circumvents restrictive parametric assumptions by clustering subjects into latent subpopulations with distinct treatment responses, where the number of subpopulations is inferred from the data. We utilize the potential outcomes framework and develop a collapsed Gibbs sampler for efficient posterior computation. Theoretical properties of the model are investigated, establishing posterior concentration rates for the CATE function under standard regularity conditions. The methodology is validated on synthetic datasets, demonstrating superior performance in capturing complex, nonlinear treatment effect heterogeneity compared to conventional methods like causal forests and BART. An application to a large-scale electronic health record dataset illustrates the model's utility in identifying patient subgroups with differential responses to a common medical intervention, providing actionable insights for personalized medicine.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,Nonparametric Bayesian Inference for Heterogeneous Causal Effects via Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Mixtures
"This research proposes a new methodology for estimating sparse high-dimensional covariance matrices when data originate from non-Gaussian, heavy-tailed distributions. Standard methods like graphical Lasso rely on sub-Gaussian assumptions that are frequently violated in practice, leading to suboptimal performance. We introduce a robust adaptive thresholding estimator that operates on a rank-based correlation matrix, such as Kendall's tau, and employs a data-driven threshold selection procedure that is resilient to outliers and heavy tails. The theoretical analysis establishes minimax optimal convergence rates in the spectral norm for a broad class of elliptical distributions. Our estimator avoids computationally intensive matrix inversions, rendering it highly scalable. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing robust and non-robust techniques in terms of estimation accuracy and support recovery, particularly under conditions of severe tail contamination.

This technique facilitates robust two-sample tests to determine if observed differences in topological summaries (e.g., Betti numbers) are statistically significant. We establish the asymptotic validity of our bootstrap method under weak dependence assumptions, making it applicable to time-series data.

"We present a doubly robust causal forest algorithm for nonparametric estimation of conditional average treatment effects (CATE) in the presence of high-dimensional confounders. The proposed method enhances the causal forest framework by incorporating doubly robust score functions directly into the tree-splitting criterion and final predictions. Specifically, each split is chosen to maximize the heterogeneity in the estimated CATE, where the local CATE is derived from locally weighted regression adjustments of the outcome and propensity score. This construction ensures that the resulting CATE estimates are consistent and asymptotically normal if either the outcome regression or the propensity score model is consistently estimated, a crucial property in high dimensions where model misspecification is likely. We derive the asymptotic distribution of our estimator and provide a consistent variance estimator based on the influence function.

Estimation is performed within a penalized likelihood framework, with smoothing parameters selected efficiently via Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML). This integrated approach provides interpretable estimates of how the influence of the functional predictor varies smoothly across space and time.

"We propose Amortized Stein Variational Gradient Descent (ASVGD), a novel method for fast and scalable posterior inference in complex Bayesian hierarchical models. Traditional MCMC methods are often prohibitively slow for large datasets, while standard variational inference can yield poor approximations. ASVGD combines the particle-based flexibility of Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) with the efficiency of amortized inference. We train an inference network to map observations from the data distribution directly to a set of particles that approximate the posterior, thereby amortizing the cost of inference. A key contribution is a new training objective based on the Kernelized Stein Discrepancy, which drives the particles to match the true posterior without requiring an explicit variational family. We provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence of the procedure. On several challenging hierarchical models, including spatial statistics and mixed-effects models, ASVGD achieves posterior approximations of comparable quality to long-run MCMC but with orders-of-magnitude reduction in computation time.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,Amortized Stein Variational Gradient Descent for Scalable Bayesian Hierarchical Models
"Detecting multiple change-points in high-dimensional time series with serial dependence is a formidable statistical problem. We propose a multiscale method, High-Dimensional Wild Binary Segmentation (HD-WBS), which extends the WBS framework to this challenging setting. HD-WBS addresses the limitations of standard binary segmentation by analyzing a large number of randomly drawn sub-intervals, which significantly increases its power to detect short-lived changes and multiple closely-spaced change-points. To handle temporal and cross-sectional dependencies, our test statistic is a CUSUM-type statistic built upon a projection of the high-dimensional series and is normalized by a consistent estimator of the long-run covariance matrix. We rigorously prove that, under mild mixing conditions and sparsity assumptions on the change-points, HD-WBS consistently estimates the number and locations of the change-points.

This paper derives novel generalization error bounds for ResNets that are sensitive to their unique architectural structure and depend polynomially, rather than exponentially, on network depth. Moving beyond standard Rademacher complexity analysis, which often yields vacuous bounds for deep models, we leverage the concept of local Rademacher complexity conditioned on low-loss function classes. Our primary technical contribution is a refined analysis of the network's Lipschitz constant, exploiting the contractive properties of residual blocks under mild regularization. This allows us to prove tighter, data-dependent bounds that incorporate norms of the weight matrices and the spectral properties of the data covariance matrix. These bounds provide theoretical justification for the empirical observation that deeper ResNets can generalize well and offer new insights into the role of skip connections in controlling model complexity, guiding more principled architectural design.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,Generalization Bounds for Deep Residual Networks via Local Rademacher Complexity
"We study the problem of estimating sparse precision matrices for high-dimensional Gaussian graphical models when the data is corrupted by cell-wise contamination, a challenging scenario where arbitrary entries in the data matrix can be outliers. Standard estimators like the graphical Lasso are notoriously brittle to such contamination. This paper introduces a novel, computationally efficient procedure, the Co-ordinate-wise Adaptive Robust Thresholding (CART) estimator. The method iteratively estimates the precision matrix and identifies potentially contaminated cells by inspecting the magnitude of the scaled residuals. A key innovation is an adaptive thresholding step that robustifies the empirical covariance matrix used in each iteration of a graphical Lasso-type algorithm. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis showing that our estimator achieves near-optimal rates of convergence under a cell-wise contamination model, provided the contamination is sufficiently sparse.

Our main result provides a tight bound for `F` corresponding to a `(k, t)`-daisy, resolving a longstanding conjecture. The proof hinges on a novel stability argument which demonstrates that any near-extremal configuration must be structurally close to a multi-layered sunflower construction.

The analysis relies on coupling the process with a multi-type branching process and applying advanced concentration inequalities, particularly Azuma-Hoeffding for martingale difference sequences derived from the boundary operator's matrix representation. Our results establish the sharp threshold `p = c/n` for this topological phase transition, determining the constant `c` as a function of `d`.

"The spatial organization of chromatin is critical for precise gene regulation, yet the mechanisms governing the formation of enhancer-promoter loops remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the POK family transcription factor ZBTB7A undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) to form transcriptional condensates. Utilizing a combination of super-resolution microscopy, Hi-C, and CUT&RUN, we show that ZBTB7A condensates preferentially form at super-enhancers, driven by multivalent interactions between its BTB/POZ domain and acetylated histones.

"Cellular proteostasis is maintained by intricate quality control mechanisms that identify and degrade aberrant proteins. We report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a novel ribosome-nascent chain complex (RNC) bound to the E3 ubiquitin ligase RQT1. The structure reveals that RQT1 engages the ribosomal exit tunnel and specifically recognizes stalled nascent polypeptides bearing C-terminal alanines and threonines (CAT-tails), a hallmark of nonstop decay. In vitro reconstitution assays combined with mass spectrometry demonstrate that RQT1, in concert with the E2 enzyme Ube2j1, polyubiquitinates the stalled nascent chain with K48-linked chains, targeting it for immediate proteasomal degradation. Furthermore, ribosome profiling in RQT1-knockout cells shows widespread ribosome pausing at cryptic polyadenylation sites, leading to proteotoxic stress.

"Mitochondrial dynamics are fundamental to cellular bioenergetics and signaling. We have identified a mitochondrial-associated long non-coding RNA, which we term *Mitofissin*, that functions as a critical regulator of mitochondrial fission. Through a combination of RNA-protein interaction screens and cellular fractionation, we show that *Mitofissin* directly binds to the SUMO E3 ligase PIAS3, localizing it to the mitochondrial outer membrane. This localization facilitates the targeted SUMOylation of Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) at lysine residue 126, a post-translational modification that significantly enhances Drp1's GTPase activity and its assembly into fission-competent oligomers. Depletion of *Mitofissin* results in hyperfused mitochondrial networks, impaired mitophagy, and increased sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli. Conversely, its overexpression promotes mitochondrial fragmentation. These findings unveil a novel regulatory axis where a non-coding RNA acts as a spatial scaffold for a post-translational modification enzyme, thereby directly controlling organellar morphology and cellular fate.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,A Long Non-Coding RNA Governs Mitochondrial Fission Dynamics by Modulating Drp1 SUMOylation

By applying simultaneous single-cell ATAC-seq and RNA-seq, we mapped the regulatory landscape of thousands of murine HSCs as they commit to either myeloid or lymphoid lineages. Our trajectory inference analysis revealed a transient, unstable intermediate progenitor state characterized by broad multi-lineage chromatin priming. We identified the transcription factor PU.1 as a pivotal regulator that resolves this ambiguity by selectively closing chromatin at lymphoid-affiliated enhancer regions while concurrently activating myeloid-specific cis-regulatory elements. Computational modeling and functional validation using CRISPR-based epigenome editing confirm that PU.1-mediated differential enhancer decommissioning constitutes an irreversible checkpoint.

"Pre-mRNA splicing, executed by the spliceosome, is a dynamic process involving two sequential transesterification reactions. While the first catalytic step is structurally well-characterized, the exon ligation step has remained enigmatic. Here, we present the 2.9 Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the human post-catalytic P complex, captured immediately following exon ligation. The structure reveals the ligated exon product threaded through a channel formed by the PRP8 and EFTUD2 proteins, poised for release. Critically, the lariat intron-2nd exon intermediate is held in a strained conformation by the step II factor PRP17, positioning the 3'-hydroxyl of the 5' exon for nucleophilic attack on the 3'-splice site phosphate. This conformation is stabilized by a coordinated network of magnesium ions and protein-RNA interactions within the catalytic core.

"The FET family protein TAF15 is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases and forms liquid-like condensates crucial for transcription. The regulation of its biophysical properties remains poorly understood. Here, we uncover a competitive post-translational modification (PTM) switch that governs TAF15 phase behavior. Using Phos-tag mobility shift assays and targeted mass spectrometry, we show that phosphorylation of a specific tyrosine residue (Y386) within the prion-like domain by SRC kinase inhibits TAF15's ability to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Conversely, methylation of an adjacent arginine (R384) by the arginine methyltransferase PRMT1 enhances LLPS and promotes the formation of hydrogel-like, less dynamic condensates. Strikingly, Y386 phosphorylation prevents subsequent R384 methylation, creating a hierarchical PTM checkpoint. In neuronal cells, synaptic activity induces SRC-mediated phosphorylation, dissolving TAF15 condensates and releasing associated transcripts. This study reveals a sophisticated PTM-based regulatory mechanism controlling the material state and function of an RNA-binding protein.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Dynamic Crosstalk between Arginine Methylation and Phosphorylation on TAF15 Controls its Phase Separation and Transcriptional Activity
"Translational control is paramount for rapid cellular adaptation to environmental cues like hypoxia. The expression of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A (VEGFA) is potently induced by low oxygen, partly through relief of translational repression. We demonstrate that the human *VEGFA* 5' UTR contains a highly conserved G-rich sequence that folds into a stable parallel G-quadruplex (G4) structure. Using SHALiPE-seq and NMR spectroscopy, we confirmed the G4's existence in vitro and in vivo. In vitro translation assays and polysome profiling reveal that this G4 structure potently inhibits translation initiation by acting as a steric block to 43S preinitiation complex scanning. Under hypoxic conditions, we observe a marked increase in the G4-resolving helicase DHX36 binding to the *VEGFA* 5' UTR, which leads to G4 unwinding and a concomitant surge in VEGFA protein synthesis.

"Aberrant activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is linked to numerous inflammatory diseases, and mitochondria are central hubs for its regulation. We report an unexpected role for the mitochondrial i-AAA protease YME1L in directly suppressing NLRP3 activity. Using unbiased proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID), we found that inactive NLRP3 is recruited to the mitochondrial intermembrane space where it directly interacts with YME1L. In vitro cleavage assays and neo-N-terminal peptide mapping demonstrate that YME1L proteolytically processes full-length NLRP3 at a specific site within its NACHT domain. This cleavage event generates two fragments that are subsequently degraded, preventing NLRP3 oligomerization and inflammasome assembly. Cells lacking YME1L exhibit heightened and prolonged NLRP3 activation in response to canonical triggers. Our results identify a novel mitochondrial checkpoint for inflammation, where an inner membrane protease acts as a direct negative regulator of a key cytosolic immune sensor, preventing excessive inflammatory responses.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,The Mitochondrial Inner Membrane AAA-Protease YME1L Cleaves NLRP3 to Attenuate Inflammasome Activation
"The segregation of metabolic pathways and gene regulation into distinct cellular compartments is a fundamental principle of eukaryotic biology. Here, we show that the canonical glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) moonlights as a nuclear histone acetyltransferase (HAT). Upon high glucose influx, a fraction of GAPDH is acetylated on lysine 117, which masks a nuclear export signal and promotes its nuclear accumulation. Within the nucleus, GAPDH utilizes its substrate-derived cofactor 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate as a donor for the non-enzymatic acetylation of histone H2B on lysine 5 (H2BK5ac). ChIP-seq analysis reveals that H2BK5ac is enriched at the promoters of glucose-responsive genes, including those involved in lipogenesis. This modification facilitates the recruitment of the transcription factor ChREBP. A non-acetylatable GAPDH mutant fails to enter the nucleus or promote H2BK5ac and target gene expression. This study uncovers a direct, unexpected link between glycolytic flux and epigenetic regulation, mediated by a metabolic enzyme acting as a transcriptional cofactor.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Metabolic Enzyme Moonlighting: Nuclear GAPDH Functions as a Transcriptional Co-activator by Acetylating Histone H2B
"The MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex is the primary sensor and processor of DNA double-strand breaks. The ATP-dependent conformational changes in RAD50 are known to regulate MRN's functions, but the allosteric mechanism linking ATP hydrolysis to MRE11's nuclease activity remains unclear. Using a combination of small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), and cryo-EM, we characterized the conformational states of the human MR complex. We show that ATP binding induces a rigid, zinc-hook-mediated dimerization of two RAD50 coiled-coil domains, forcing a concomitant conformational change in the MRE11 homodimer. This 'engaged' state repositions a key leucine residue in MRE11's nuclease domain, unlocking its catalytic site and increasing its processivity on DNA substrates by an order of magnitude. A non-hydrolyzable ATP analog traps the complex in this hyperactive state, while ATP hydrolysis disengages the RAD50 dimer, resetting MRE11 to its basal activity.

By treating the bulk spacetime as a dynamical entity subject to holographic renormalization group flow, we demonstrate that quantum fluctuations of conformal fields on the boundary induce a running of the bulk vacuum energy. Our model employs a functional Schrödinger formalism to derive the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the boundary-dual field theory coupled to gravity. We show that the zero-point energy contributions, typically responsible for the large discrepancy, are absorbed into the redefinition of coupling constants in the boundary theory's effective action. The resultant emergent cosmological constant is dynamically driven towards a stable, near-zero fixed point without fine-tuning. This approach suggests that the observed small value of Λ is a consequence of the infrared properties of a strongly coupled quantum system, offering a novel resolution paradigm rooted in holographic duality.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Fizik,Generated,Holographic Renormalization and the Cosmological Constant in a Non-Perturbative Framework

Utilizing Floquet engineering, we subject a two-dimensional Hubbard model to a high-frequency, circularly polarized electromagnetic field. Through a combination of non-equilibrium dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) and a high-frequency expansion, we derive an effective static Hamiltonian. Our results show that the periodic drive opens a gap in the electronic spectrum and induces a non-zero Chern number, characteristic of a quantum anomalous Hall phase. This dynamically-generated topological state supports chiral edge modes that are resilient to disorder and local perturbations, even in the presence of strong electronic correlations.

Our analysis shows that in a high-field (B > 10 T) environment, the effective axion-photon coupling is significantly enhanced, leading to a modified vacuum magnetic birefringence and dichroism. We calculate the expected rotation and ellipticity induced on a probe laser beam traversing a resonant microwave cavity embedded in a strong magnetic dipole field. The predicted signal scales quadratically with the background field strength, offering a substantial improvement in sensitivity over existing haloscope and light-shining-through-wall experiments.

Our semi-classical analysis incorporates gravitational backreaction and one-loop corrections from bulk quantum fields. We locate the quantum extremal surface (QES) and demonstrate that its area, plus the entanglement entropy of bulk fields in the entanglement wedge, adheres to a unitary Page curve. We find that both charge and angular momentum delay the Page time and suppress the growth rate of the island. Crucially, the location of the QES is sensitive to the greybody factors of the emitted radiation, explicitly connecting the spacetime geometry to the quantum information content. This work reinforces the universality of the QES prescription and provides a quantitative framework for understanding information release from realistic astrophysical black holes.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Fizik,Generated,Quantum Extremal Surfaces and Entanglement Entropy Corrections in Evaporating Kerr-Newman Black Holes

We demonstrate a clear scale-dependent anisotropy, where the energy cascade proceeds primarily perpendicular to the local mean magnetic field, consistent with the critical balance conjecture. Furthermore, we quantify the intermittency by calculating high-order structure functions of the Elsasser variables. The resulting scaling exponents deviate significantly from the predictions of both Kolmogorov's K41 and Iroshnikov-Kraichnan theories, indicating that energy dissipation is concentrated in spatially intermittent, sheet-like structures.

The passive component involves engineering the spectral density of the electromagnetic environment to which the qubits are coupled, creating a 'protective' frequency band-gap that inhibits spontaneous emission. The active component utilizes rapid, periodic projective measurements, leveraging the quantum Zeno effect to freeze the system's evolution away from a desired subspace. Using a Lindblad master equation formalism, we model a system of coupled superconducting transmon qubits and demonstrate a two-orders-of-magnitude increase in the coherence time of a Bell state.

Using Brillouin light scattering and angle-resolved ultrasonic transmission spectroscopy, we directly mapped the bulk phononic dispersion relations, identifying pairs of topologically protected linear touching points—the Weyl points. As predicted by the bulk-boundary correspondence, these Weyl points give rise to topologically protected surface acoustic waves, which we observed as frequency-isolated, one-way propagating modes on the crystal surface.

We prove that the coefficients of these polynomials form a log-concave sequence, thereby affirmatively answering a conjecture by Gedeon, Proudfoot, and Young. The proof is geometric in nature; we realize the q-matroid Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial as the intersection cohomology Poincare polynomial of a specially constructed Schubert variety within an affine Grassmannian. By establishing that this variety is rationally smooth and its corresponding toric variety admits a convex polytope decomposition, we apply the Hodge-Riemann relations for intersection cohomology to deduce the desired log-concavity. This result provides the first geometric proof of log-concavity for any class of combinatorially defined Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and suggests a deep connection between matroid theory and the geometry of flag varieties.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Matematik,Generated,Log-Concavity of the Kazhdan-Lusztig Polynomials of q-Matroids

We develop a framework based on analytic combinatorics in several variables (ACSV) and stratified Morse theory to derive precise asymptotic formulae for the number of paths of a given length. The dominant singularity of the generating function is shown to correspond to a minimal point of the defining polynomial on the positive real torus. Our primary contribution is a rigorous method to handle singularities arising from the intersection of multiple algebraic surfaces, which yields asymptotic terms with non-rational critical exponents.

The proof integrates techniques from additive combinatorics and representation theory. We develop a non-abelian Fourier analysis framework tailored to the specific conjugacy class structure of G, defining uniformity norms that are sensitive to arithmetic progressions. A density increment argument is then implemented, using a generalized Bogolyubov-Ruzsa lemma adapted to the approximate subgroup structure of these groups.

We prove that for d ≥ 3, the property of containing a Hamiltonian cycle exhibits a sharp threshold. Specifically, we use the second moment method and a multi-round exposure technique to demonstrate that the hitting time for Hamiltonicity coincides with the hitting time for minimum vertex degree k, where k is a function of d and Δ. This resolves a question about whether local geometric constraints significantly alter the global properties of random hypergraphs.

Our main theorem asserts that if a certain cyclotomic integer, derived from the design's parameters, is not a perfect square in the p-th cyclotomic field, then no such design exists. This criterion is applied to resolve several long-standing open cases in the classification of cyclic difference sets and affine planes.

We prove that for any claw-free perfect graph, the Chvatal rank of its stable set polytope is exactly one. This means the integral hull is obtained after a single round of applying all possible Chvatal-Gomory cutting planes. The proof relies on a structural decomposition theorem for claw-free perfect graphs due to Chvatal and Sbihi, combined with a polyhedral argument showing that any non-integral vertex of the fractional polytope can be separated by a rank-1 cut derived from an odd hole or antihole in an auxiliary graph construction.

The core of our argument involves constructing a Z_k-equivariant chain map from the standard chromatic complex to the chain complex of the nerve of a specific covering of D(G, k). By applying discrete Morse theory and spectral sequence arguments, we show this homological obstruction is computationally more tractable than determining the chromatic number directly and strictly stronger than obstructions based on the box complex for certain graph families.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Matematik,Generated,Homological Obstructions to k-Colorability of Dowker Complexes

The HEE, calculated via the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, serves as a proxy for quantum correlations within the boundary field theory. Our analysis reveals a distinct phase transition in the HEE, corresponding to the confinement-deconfinement transition, which manifests as a topological change in the minimal surface configuration within the bulk spacetime. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the entanglement entropy scaling behavior provides a quantitative measure of the chiral condensate, offering a novel, information-theoretic order parameter for chiral symmetry breaking.

Instead of thermalizing to an infinite-temperature state as predicted for generic non-integrable Floquet systems, the system retains local memory of its initial state indefinitely. We characterize the MBL phase by examining the level statistics of the Floquet operator's quasi-energies, the long-time behavior of local observables, and the logarithmic growth of entanglement entropy following a quantum quench.

Our platform consists of two coupled whispering-gallery-mode optical microcavities, where PT-symmetry is realized by balancing optical gain in one cavity with an equivalent loss in the other. Below a critical coupling strength, the system exhibits a purely real eigenspectrum, characteristic of the PT-symmetric phase. As the inter-cavity coupling is reduced past an exceptional point, the system undergoes a spontaneous phase transition into a PT-broken phase, marked by the emergence of complex conjugate eigenfrequencies. This transition is observed through high-resolution transmission spectroscopy, which reveals both the coalescence of resonant frequencies and the bifurcation of their linewidths.

We employ Bogoliubov transformations to relate the Minkowski vacuum to the Rindler particle basis, revealing that Rob's accelerated trajectory causes him to perceive the Minkowski vacuum as a thermal bath—the Unruh effect. Our calculations explicitly show that the entanglement, as quantified by concurrence, is degraded as a function of Rob's acceleration. For infinite acceleration, the entanglement vanishes completely.

Our approach leverages the Quantum Zeno Effect (QZE), wherein frequent projective measurements onto a desired subspace can inhibit the system's natural Hamiltonian evolution. In our scheme, a global microwave field continuously attempts to drive a transition out of the Rydberg manifold, while a strong, resonant laser beam, coupled to a short-lived auxiliary state, effectively performs a continuous measurement to project the atom back into the manifold. We derive an effective master equation for this driven-dissipative system, demonstrating that the effective spontaneous emission rate is quadratically suppressed by the measurement strength.

Our model predicts a universal, energy-dependent decoherence rate that does not require coupling to an external thermal environment. We apply this formalism to a macroscopic quantum superposition of a center-of-mass position, showing that the decoherence time scale is consistent with observational bounds and provides a potential explanation for the quantum-to-classical transition.

The crucial finding is that the sign of this surface anomalous Hall conductivity is determined by the surface orientation, leading to a configuration where chiral, one-dimensional modes necessarily emerge along the hinges where these gapped surfaces meet. We characterize this phenomenon through a bulk topological invariant, the axion polarizability vector, and explicitly calculate the hinge-state spectrum using a low-energy effective theory and tight-binding lattice models. We further predict that in a cubic geometry, these hinge states give rise to a quantized, two-terminal hinge conductance of e²/h.

Conventional diffusion models operating in Euclidean space fail to respect the intrinsic geometric priors of such data, leading to invalid or low-quality generations. Our framework redefines the forward diffusion process as a stochastic differential equation on a Riemannian manifold, and the reverse-time denoising process is learned as a neural network that predicts a score function in the tangent space at each point. This ensures that the entire generative trajectory remains on the manifold. We employ a novel self-conditioning mechanism based on the Riemannian metric tensor to improve sampling efficiency. Empirical results on benchmark datasets for 3D protein backbone generation and shape synthesis demonstrate that SMDMs significantly outperform state-of-the-art generative models in structural validity and distributional fidelity, establishing a new paradigm for geometry-aware deep generative modeling.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Stochastic Manifold Diffusion Models for Geometric Structure Generation

Furthermore, we incorporate an information-theoretic bottleneck, minimizing the mutual information between messages and agent states while preserving task performance, thereby encouraging the emergence of minimal, sufficient communication protocols. We demonstrate in a series of cooperative and competitive tasks that CEPG agents develop more robust, generalizable, and interpretable communication strategies compared to agents trained with standard policy gradient methods.

HR-TGC operates on a hypergraph representation where edges (hyper-relations) are themselves dynamic entities with learnable temporal embeddings. The core of our model is a dual-stream attention mechanism: one stream computes temporal attention over the evolution of a specific hyper-relation, while the other computes cross-relational attention at each timestamp. This allows the model to learn not only how relations evolve but also how they influence each other over time. Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks for financial transaction networks and academic collaboration graphs show that HR-TGC significantly surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in dynamic link prediction and node classification tasks, especially in non-stationary environments.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Hyper-Relational Temporal Graph Convolutions for Dynamic Heterogeneous Networks

LSPC operates by identifying minimal, cohesive perturbations within the model's contextualized latent embedding space (e.g., the output of a specific attention layer) that are sufficient to alter the model's prediction. These latent perturbations are then projected back to the input space via a learned inversion mapping, ensuring semantic plausibility. We formalize this as a constrained optimization problem solved with a projected gradient descent algorithm.

B-HENT employs a recurrent neural network to process a sequence of task-specific loss gradients and update a latent representation of the current task distribution. This latent representation conditions a Bayesian hypernetwork, which in turn generates posterior distributions over the parameters of a target few-shot learner. This hierarchical Bayesian approach allows the model to capture uncertainty about the task distribution itself, enabling rapid adaptation and preventing catastrophic forgetting when the distribution shifts.

Crucially, the rank of the approximation is not fixed but is dynamically adapted based on a measure of local curvature and the optimizer's progress, allocating more resources to regions of high non-convexity. This dynamic rank allocation allows ALRHA to flexibly interpolate between first-order and quasi-Newton methods.

VIVL posits a latent variable model where a subset of the latent space acts as a valid instrument, i.e., it is correlated with the treatment but independent of the confounders. We formulate a variational lower bound on the data log-likelihood that includes a penalization term, derived from kernel-based independence tests, to enforce the IV conditions in the latent space.

The core innovation is a novel information-theoretic objective, based on the Jensen-Shannon divergence, which is robust to noise and modality-specific nuisance variables. Furthermore, we introduce a technique of non-isomorphic data augmentations—applying semantically distinct augmentations to each modality (e.g., time-stretching audio and color-jittering video)—to force the model to learn higher-level, abstract concepts rather than low-level statistical correlations.

Each instrument from a large orchestral sample library is represented as a point on this manifold. We hypothesize that the perceptual quality of an orchestral blend corresponds to the geodesic distance between its constituent timbres on the learned manifold. We validate this model through MUSHRA-style listening tests where subjects rate the 'blend quality' of various instrumental pairs and triads.

"This paper posits that the perceptual complexity of a melody is quantifiable through its algorithmic information content, or Kolmogorov complexity. As this measure is uncomputable, we approximate it using Lempel-Ziv compression algorithms and predictive information rate from statistical n-gram models. We analyze a diverse corpus of melodies, from Western folk tunes to serialist compositions, and compute their information content profiles. These quantitative metrics are then correlated with perceptual complexity ratings obtained from human listeners. Our results show a strong positive correlation between algorithmic complexity and perceived complexity, outperforming traditional metrics based on interval size or contour entropy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that local minima in the predictive information rate align with points of high musical tension and surprise, as identified by listeners.

"The independent manipulation of pitch and timbre in polyphonic audio remains a formidable challenge in signal processing. This research introduces a novel unsupervised learning model based on a beta-variational autoencoder (β-VAE) to learn disentangled latent representations of these core musical attributes. The model's encoder, a deep convolutional network, processes complex spectrograms and maps them to a structured latent space, where specific dimensions are encouraged, via a modified objective function, to exclusively encode variations in pitch (f0) while others encode timbral characteristics. The decoder can then reconstruct the audio from manipulated latent vectors. We demonstrate the model's efficacy on the URMP dataset, showing state-of-the-art performance in tasks such as instrument timbre transfer across different melodies and pitch-shifting without significant timbral artifacts. This approach enables intuitive, high-fidelity sound manipulation and provides a powerful new tool for computational musicology and audio production.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Disentangled Timbre and Pitch Representations in Polyphonic Audio via a Beta-Variational Autoencoder
"Conventional methods for analyzing musical form often rely on heuristic-based segmentation or pre-defined templates, limiting their applicability to non-standard structures. This paper introduces a novel, parameter-free approach using topological data analysis (TDA). We transform a musical piece into a point cloud by constructing a self-dissimilarity matrix from time-lagged chroma features. We then apply persistent homology to this point cloud to study its topological features (connected components, loops) across different scales. The resulting persistence diagram serves as a unique 'topological signature' of the piece. We demonstrate that the lifespans of 0-dimensional homology classes (connected components) correspond directly to the salience and duration of recurring thematic sections, while 1-dimensional classes (loops) capture large-scale cyclic structures like ABA forms. This TDA-based method provides a mathematically rigorous and robust framework for discovering hierarchical structure and formal archetypes across a wide range of musical styles.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Topological Signatures of Musical Form: A Persistent Homology Approach to Structural Analysis
"We investigate the holographic principle in a de Sitter (dS) spacetime background, proposing a novel correspondence between a central Euclidean conformal field theory (CFT) and the static patch of dS space. Central to our formalism is the role of entanglement entropy as a thermodynamic entropy, linking the Gibbons-Hawking entropy to the entanglement of degrees of freedom across the cosmological horizon. By employing tensor network techniques, specifically the Multiscale Entanglement Renormalization Ansatz (MERA), we construct a holographic geometry that qualitatively reproduces the hyperbolic foliation of the dS static patch. Our analysis reveals that the quantum-corrected Ryu-Takayanagi formula, when applied to specific bipartite entanglements in the boundary CFT, correctly computes the horizon area.

The interplay between the synthetic gauge fields induced by the driving protocol and the non-Hermitian terms leads to the emergence of exceptional points and a complex band structure with a gapped bulk spectrum. We demonstrate the existence of robust, zero-dimensional corner states with complex eigenfrequencies, a hallmark of non-Hermitian HOTIs.

"We propose a novel inflationary paradigm wherein the inflaton field is kinetically coupled to an ultralight axion, leading to a modified cosmic expansion history that can alleviate the persistent Hubble tension. During inflation, quantum fluctuations of the axion field induce a time-varying effective Planck mass, which subtly alters the primordial power spectrum of scalar perturbations. This modification introduces a scale-dependent feature that is degenerate with changes in the effective number of relativistic species (N_eff) at the time of recombination. Our numerical analysis, utilizing a modified Boltzmann code and confronting the model with Planck CMB, BAO, and SH0ES data, demonstrates that this mechanism can yield a higher H0 value without compromising the excellent fit to CMB anisotropies.

A subsequent measurement on the photon in a specific basis projects the mirror into a superposition of two distinct spatial locations, separated by a distance exceeding its zero-point motion. We detail a verification procedure involving a second interaction pulse that reverses the entanglement, mapping the mirror's coherence onto the photonic state for readout.

Utilizing whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), we tracked DNA methylation and histone H3K27ac modification patterns across three generations exposed to simulated predation cues. Our findings reveal heritable epigenetic marks, termed 'epialleles,' that are stochastically induced by environmental stress and correlate strongly with adaptive morphological traits, such as defensive crest height. These epialleles exhibit Mendelian-like segregation patterns in subsequent asexual generations but are partially reset during sexual reproduction.

To disentangle the roles of phylogeny and convergent selection, we performed a comparative transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis of caste differentiation across ten species of ants, bees, and termites. Despite vast phylogenetic distance and different ploidy systems, we identified a core set of convergently recruited regulatory genes and pathways governing caste determination, including vitellogenin-like proteins and insulin/TOR signaling. Furthermore, our analysis of chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) revealed that the regulatory elements controlling these core genes have evolved convergently, often arising from exapted transposable elements.

These convergent changes were not attributable to neutral processes like biased gene conversion or mutational hotspots.

We explored the role of TE exaptation in the spectacular adaptive radiation of African cichlid fishes. Through a comparative transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis (ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq) across five Malawi cichlid species exhibiting distinct craniofacial morphologies, we identified thousands of lineage-specific, TE-derived regulatory elements. These elements, primarily from SINE and LINE families, function as enhancers and insulators, significantly rewiring gene regulatory networks associated with pharyngeal jaw development. We show that the activation of these cryptic regulatory sites is correlated with differential expression of key developmental genes like *pax9* and *runx2*. Our findings provide compelling evidence that TE mobilization and subsequent co-option into host regulatory architecture is a fundamental mechanism facilitating rapid morphological diversification and niche exploitation, acting as a crucial substrate for natural selection.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Transposable Element Exaptation as a Major Driver of Regulatory Network Rewiring and Adaptive Innovation
"The role of non-Mendelian inheritance in adaptive evolution is a subject of intense debate. This study investigates the contribution of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TEI) to phenotypic plasticity in *Arabidopsis thaliana*. We subjected isogenic lines to simulated drought stress for three generations and subsequently assessed the phenotype and epigenome of unexposed F4 progeny. Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and RNA-seq, we identified hundreds of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that were stably inherited in the absence of the initial stressor. These inherited DMRs are significantly enriched near genes involved in ABA signaling and osmotic stress response, and their methylation status correlates with enhanced drought tolerance and altered root architecture in the F4 generation. Our results demonstrate that inherited epigenetic modifications can prime future generations for anticipated environmental challenges, representing a Lamarckian-like mechanism that can significantly influence the rate and trajectory of adaptation by modulating heritable reaction norms.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Transgenerational Epigenetic Inheritance Modulates Phenotypic Plasticity and Adaptive Potential in Response to Environmental Stress
"Cryptic speciation, where genetically distinct lineages are morphologically indistinguishable, is thought to be widespread in microorganisms, complicating our understanding of biodiversity and ecosystem function. We investigated cryptic diversity within the ubiquitous marine cyanobacterium *Prochlorococcus*. By combining single-cell amplified genomics (SAGs) with large-scale marine metatranscriptomics, we resolved multiple deeply divergent, co-occurring clades previously classified as a single ecotype. These cryptic species exhibit distinct metabolic potentials encoded in their genomes, including differential utilization of nitrogen sources and vitamins. In situ gene expression profiles confirm fine-scale niche partitioning, with expression of key metabolic genes tightly correlated with specific physicochemical parameters of the water column.

"The timing and tempo of the Cambrian explosion, the rapid emergence of most animal phyla, remains a central question in evolutionary biology. Discrepancies between molecular clock estimates and the fossil record have fueled extensive debate. We present a new timescale for early animal evolution by integrating a comprehensive new morphological matrix of Ediacaran and Cambrian fossils with a 250-gene phylogenomic dataset. Using Bayesian total-evidence dating under the fossilized birth-death process, our analysis places the initial divergence of major metazoan clades deeper in the Cryogenian period than previously thought. However, the rates of morphological evolution and cladogenesis show an unprecedented spike during the early-to-mid Cambrian (Series 2-3), consistent with fossil evidence for an 'explosion' of anatomical disparity. This integrated approach reconciles molecular and paleontological data, suggesting a 'long fuse' of cryptic evolution followed by a burst of ecological opportunity and developmental innovation driving the Cambrian radiation.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Re-evaluating the Cambrian Explosion via Integrated Paleontological and Molecular Clock Analyses with Fossilized Birth-Death Models
"Host-parasite coevolution is often characterized by reciprocal selective pressures, leading to Red Queen dynamics. However, the genetic architecture underlying coevolutionary traits can impose significant constraints. We developed a stochastic individual-based model to investigate the coevolutionary trajectory of a host-parasite system where a single host locus confers resistance but also carries a pleiotropic fitness cost (antagonistic pleiotropy). Our simulations demonstrate that high pleiotropic costs prevent the fixation of resistance alleles, leading to stable, long-term polymorphisms instead of classic arms-race dynamics or recurrent selective sweeps. We observe sustained oscillations in both host and parasite allelic frequencies, but the amplitude and period of these cycles are critically dependent on the cost of virulence in the parasite and the cost of resistance in the host. These findings suggest that pleiotropic constraints are a key factor in maintaining genetic variation in natural populations and can shift coevolutionary dynamics from directional selection to balancing selection.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Antagonistic Pleiotropy Constrains the Coevolutionary Dynamics of Host Resistance and Parasite Virulence
"Hybridization can facilitate rapid adaptation by introducing pre-adapted alleles across species boundaries.

Using whole-genome sequencing of individuals sampled across an elevational and hybrid-zone gradient, we identified discrete genomic regions with steep clines in allele frequency, indicative of strong differential selection. These regions, which show significant introgression from the high-elevation specialist *P. brandegeei* into the lower-elevation *P. viscosum*, contain genes associated with osmotic regulation and cold-acclimation pathways. Loci within these introgressed blocks exhibit reduced nucleotide diversity and extended linkage disequilibrium, consistent with recent selective sweeps.

We investigated the macroevolutionary history of the avian cranial system, a highly integrated structure, using 3D geometric morphometric data from 250 bird species and a novel time-calibrated phylogeny. By applying multivariate phylogenetic comparative methods, including Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models and stochastic character mapping, we reconstructed the evolutionary trajectory of cranial shape across morphospace. Our results reject a model of simple, concerted evolution. Instead, we reveal a pattern of mosaic evolution, where distinct cranial modules (e.g., rostrum, neurocranium) exhibit semi-independent evolutionary rates and trajectories. Rate-shift analyses identify significant accelerations in rostrum evolution correlated with diversification events in clades undergoing specialized feeding adaptations, such as finches and shorebirds.

Electric organs have evolved independently six times in teleost fishes, offering a classic example of phenotypic convergence. We investigated the underlying genomic architecture by sequencing and analyzing the genomes of three independently evolved electric fish lineages. Our comparative genomic analysis revealed that the evolution of electrogenesis is consistently linked to the repurposing of the *Scn4a* gene, which encodes a voltage-gated sodium channel subunit expressed in skeletal muscle. We identified a striking pattern of parallel evolution at the molecular level, with numerous identical and equivalent amino acid substitutions occurring in key functional domains of the Scn4a protein across independent lineages. These parallel substitutions alter channel gating kinetics, a crucial modification for generating electric organ discharge.

"The transition from unicellular to multicellular life represents a major transition in individuality, requiring the evolution of mechanisms to suppress conflict among constituent cells. A key innovation is the evolution of a sterile soma and a segregated germline. Using a multi-level selection framework and agent-based modeling, we explored the conditions favoring the evolution of germ-soma differentiation. Our model demonstrates that the evolution of a sterile soma is favored when the fitness benefits of specialized somatic function (e.g., resource acquisition, motility) are high and when the cost of producing germline cells is substantial. Critically, we find that high genetic relatedness among cells is a necessary but not sufficient condition; the transition also requires the emergence of 'policing' mechanisms that suppress cellular cheating.

We map the phase diagram as a function of driving frequency and disorder strength, pinpointing the MBL transition through finite-size scaling of entanglement variance. A key finding is the existence of a long-lived prethermal plateau preceding the eventual localization, governed by an emergent effective static Hamiltonian. This prethermal MBL regime displays slow, power-law entanglement growth before saturating at a value determined by the system's proximity to the transition.

"Randomized smoothing has emerged as a state-of-the-art technique for providing certifiable guarantees of robustness against adversarial attacks. However, its efficacy diminishes significantly in high-dimensional input spaces. We propose Latent Space Smoothing (LSS), a novel certified defense that operates in the low-dimensional, disentangled latent space of a pre-trained generative model, such as a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Our method applies Gaussian smoothing to the latent vector representation of an input before decoding and classification. This strategy circumvents the curse of dimensionality and allows for substantially larger certified radii. We derive a tight theoretical bound that relates the certified L2 radius in the latent space to a corresponding, non-trivial robustness guarantee in the high-dimensional pixel space. Empirically, we demonstrate on CIFAR-10 and CelebA that LSS achieves a certified accuracy that is orders of magnitude better than smoothing applied directly to the input space.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Certified Adversarial Robustness via Randomized Smoothing in Disentangled Latent Spaces
"We introduce Abductive Logic-Tensor Networks (A-LTN), a novel neuro-symbolic framework for complex, multi-hop reasoning over incomplete knowledge graphs. A-LTN synergizes the perceptual capabilities of graph neural networks for entity embedding with the formal reasoning power of first-order logic. The core of our framework is a differentiable abductive reasoning module that learns to hypothesize missing links (lemmas) in the knowledge graph to complete a logical proof path for a given query. This process is guided by a probabilistic logical consistency loss, which ensures that hypothesized facts cohere with the existing knowledge base. This architecture allows for end-to-end training from question-answer pairs while generating fully interpretable, symbolic proof-trees for its inferences. A-LTN establishes a new state-of-the-art on complex reasoning datasets like MetaQA and WebQuestionsSP, demonstrating superior performance in handling sparse and noisy knowledge graphs.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning over Knowledge Graphs via Abductive Logic-Tensor Networks
"Predicting the future trajectories of multiple interacting agents is critical for autonomous systems. This paper introduces the Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention Network (STGAT), a novel architecture for modeling complex, non-linear agent interactions. We represent the scene as a dynamic graph where nodes are agents and edges encode their spatial and social relationships. STGAT employs a dual-head graph attention mechanism to learn anisotropic interaction weights, dynamically distinguishing between social influence and spatial proximity. A Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architecture propagates the temporal dynamics of the agent states and the graph structure itself. To capture the inherent uncertainty of human behavior, the model outputs a multimodal probabilistic distribution over future trajectories using a Mixture Density Network. Evaluated on the challenging nuScenes and Argoverse autonomous driving datasets, STGAT demonstrates significant improvements in prediction accuracy and realism over current state-of-the-art methods, particularly in dense, interactive scenarios.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention Networks for Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction
"To address catastrophic forgetting in neural networks, we propose a bio-inspired continual learning algorithm, Synaptic Metaplasticity with Orthogonal Projection (SMOP). Our framework maintains a dynamically updated trace of parameter importance for previous tasks, modeled after the principles of synaptic metaplasticity. When learning a new task, SMOP projects the calculated gradients onto the orthogonal complement of the subspace spanned by the most important features of past tasks. This null-space projection rigorously prevents interference with previously acquired knowledge while allowing for maximal plasticity in orthogonal directions for learning new information. The metaplastic importance measure allows for efficient online updates without storing past data. We demonstrate on challenging class-incremental benchmarks, including Split-ImageNet and CORE50, that SMOP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art replay-free and regularization-based methods, achieving superior knowledge retention and forward transfer.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Continual Learning with Synaptic Metaplasticity and Orthogonal Gradient Projection
"Morphological stasis in marine invertebrates often conceals substantial genetic diversity, complicating biogeographic and evolutionary analyses. We employed restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) to interrogate the systematics of the circum-Antarctic ophiuroid species complex, Ophionotus victoriae. Coalescent-based species delimitation models and phylogenomic inference robustly identified at least five deeply divergent, reproductively isolated lineages, previously unrecognized based on morphology. Divergence time estimation using fossil-calibrated molecular clocks places the primary cladogenic events in the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene. These periods correlate with major shifts in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the expansion of ice sheets, suggesting allopatric speciation driven by oceanographic barriers. Our findings demonstrate that polar biodiversity is significantly underestimated and highlight the efficacy of genomic approaches in uncovering cryptic speciation patterns sculpted by paleo-climatic dynamics.

"The role of non-Mendelian inheritance in rapid adaptation remains a contentious frontier in evolutionary biology. This study investigates the contribution of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance to adaptive evolution in the mangrove killifish, Kryptolebias marmoratus. We exposed isogenic lineages to sustained hypo- and hyper-salinity stress over five generations and performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) on F5 offspring. We identified hundreds of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that were stably inherited in the absence of the initial stressor. These heritable DMRs were significantly enriched in the promoter regions of genes associated with osmoregulation and ion transport, including key ion-pump ATPases. Crucially, offspring from pre-exposed lineages exhibited significantly higher survival rates and more stable gill Na+/K+-ATPase activity when challenged with acute salinity stress. These findings provide compelling evidence that heritable DNA methylation can act as a substrate for rapid adaptive evolution, facilitating physiological pre-adaptation to fluctuating environmental conditions.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Transgenerational DNA Methylation Mediates Rapid Adaptive Response to Salinity Stress in a Mangrove Killifish
"The extinction dynamics of Pleistocene megafauna are central to understanding the interplay of climate change and anthropogenic pressures.

Using pairwise sequentially Markovian coalescent (PSMC) analysis, we reconstructed a demographic history characterized by a high effective population size (Ne) throughout the Middle Pleistocene, followed by a precipitous decline beginning approximately 25,000 years ago, coinciding with the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). D-statistic tests reveal significant evidence of archaic introgression from a ghost sister lineage that diverged over 1.5 Ma. The terminal decline post-LGM was not correlated with human population expansion but with increased climatic volatility inferred from paleoclimatic proxies.

"Antagonistic coevolution is hypothesized to maintain genetic polymorphism via negative frequency-dependent selection (NFDS), a cornerstone of Red Queen dynamics. We tested this hypothesis directly using resurrection ecology, reviving dormant eggs of the water flea Daphnia longispina and spores of its parasite Pasteuria ramosa from dated sediment core layers spanning 20 years. Whole-genome sequencing of resurrected host and parasite populations revealed temporally lagged cyclical dynamics in allele frequencies at key host immune loci (e.g., pattern recognition receptors) and parasite infectivity loci (e.g., spore-surface glycoproteins). Time-shift infection assays confirmed that parasites were most infective against common contemporary host genotypes and least infective against future common genotypes. This demonstrates a persistent coevolutionary arms race driven by strong NFDS, providing empirical genomic evidence for the Red Queen process as a powerful mechanism for the long-term maintenance of host and parasite genetic diversity in natural ecosystems.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Time-Shifted Genomic Analyses Uncover Negative Frequency-Dependent Selection in a Daphnia-Parasite Coevolutionary Arms Race
"The evolution of eusociality, characterized by reproductive division of labor, is classically explained by kin selection theory. However, this framework often overlooks intragenomic conflict between maternally and paternally derived alleles. We investigated this conflict's role in the primitively eusocial sweat bee, Lasioglossum albipes, using parent-specific expression analysis (PSE) in developing queen and worker larvae. We identified over 200 genes exhibiting significant parent-of-origin expression bias, many of which are homologues of known insect growth and development regulators like Insulin/TOR pathway components. Critically, we observed a significant excess of paternally expressed genes promoting worker-like traits and maternally expressed genes promoting queen-like development, consistent with theoretical predictions of parental conflict over caste fate. Our results suggest that the evolutionary trajectory towards obligate eusociality is not merely a consequence of maximizing inclusive fitness but is also shaped by the resolution of this profound intragenomic conflict.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Intragenomic Conflict Over Caste Determination Underpins the Evolutionary Trajectory of Eusociality in Halictid Bees
"Convergent evolution provides powerful evidence for adaptation, yet its molecular underpinnings are often complex. We performed a large-scale comparative phylogenomic analysis across 63 avian genomes, including 15 high-altitude lineages, to identify the molecular basis of convergent adaptation to hypoxia. Using codon-based models of evolution and controlling for phylogenetic non-independence, we detected strong signals of recurrent positive selection in two key genes of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway: EGLN1 (prolyl hydroxylase 2) and EPAS1 (HIF-2α). We identified multiple parallel amino acid substitutions at specific, functionally important sites within these proteins across independent high-altitude radiations. These recurrent substitutions, confirmed to alter protein function in vitro, indicate that adaptation to high-altitude environments is highly predictable at the molecular level. The evolution of hypoxia tolerance in birds has repeatedly navigated a constrained adaptive landscape, targeting the same regulatory pathway to achieve a convergent physiological phenotype.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Recurrent Adaptive Substitutions in the Hypoxia-Inducible Factor Pathway Facilitated Convergent Evolution of High-Altitude Homeostasis in Avians
"Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is a primary driver of prokaryotic evolution, but its role in shaping eukaryotic genomes is considered more limited. Here, we challenge this view through single-cell genomics and metagenomics of benthic foraminifera from an anoxic marine basin. We assembled near-complete genomes for three species of the genus Stainforthia, revealing a mosaic architecture. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that over 10% of their protein-coding genes are of bacterial or archaeal origin, acquired through multiple independent HGT events. These laterally acquired genes are not randomly distributed but are functionally integrated into core metabolic pathways, including denitrification and anaerobic respiration, which are absent in their aerobic relatives. This massive influx of prokaryotic genes has fundamentally reconfigured foraminiferal metabolism, enabling their colonization and diversification within oxygen-depleted environments. Our findings posit HGT as a major, underappreciated engine of metabolic innovation and adaptive radiation in microbial eukaryotes.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Massive Prokaryotic-to-Eukaryotic Horizontal Gene Transfer Drove the Metabolic Diversification of Anaerobic Foraminifera
"Macroevolutionary patterns of long-term morphological stasis present a challenge to conventional microevolutionary theory. We investigated the stasis observed in the Devonian trilobite Phacops rana over a 5-million-year interval using high-resolution 3D geometric morphometrics and homology-based inference of developmental gene regulatory networks. Our morphometric analysis of 350 fossil specimens reveals that despite environmental fluctuations, phenotypic variation was highly constrained along a single, dominant axis of allometric change. The cephalic and pygidial tagmata showed exceptionally low morphological disparity. Comparative analysis of inferred developmental gene expression domains, based on conserved arthropod patterning, indicates deep conservation of the Hox and segment polarity gene networks. We propose that strong developmental canalization, governed by a deeply entrenched and pleiotropic gene regulatory architecture, rather than persistent stabilizing selection, was the primary mechanism buffering the Phacops bauplan against evolutionary change, thus providing a developmental-genetic explanation for punctuated equilibrium.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Geometric Morphometrics and Developmental Gene Expression in Devonian Trilobites Support a Model of Canalization-Driven Morphological Stasis
"Complex sexual ornaments are key to understanding sexual selection, but their genetic basis remains poorly understood. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for carotenoid-based plumage coloration in a wild, pedigreed population of 1,200 house finches (Haemorhous mexicanus). The trait is highly polygenic, with over 300 loci of small effect collectively explaining 45% of the phenotypic variance. Genes at associated loci were enriched for functions in lipid transport and oxidative stress response, supporting the condition-dependence hypothesis. However, we uncovered significant evidence for sexual antagonism: a polygenic score for high male coloration was negatively correlated with key female fitness components, including clutch size and lifespan, likely due to widespread pleiotropy. These findings indicate that the evolution of this canonical sexual ornament is constrained not only by its honesty-signaling function but also by intralocus sexual conflict, which may limit its response to directional selection and maintain genetic variation.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,The Polygenic Architecture of a Nuptial Plumage Trait Reveals Widespread Pleiotropy and Sexual Antagonism in a Passerine

Within 500 generations, all 10 replicate populations evolved obligately clonal multicellular clusters, or 'snowflake' phenotypes. Whole-genome sequencing of evolved clones from independent lineages revealed a striking pattern of convergent evolution: a majority of lineages acquired mutations within a single gene encoding a membrane-anchored protein containing a conserved cadherin-like domain. Re-introduction of the most common non-synonymous substitution via CRISPR-Cas9 into the ancestral strain was sufficient to induce facultative cell-cell adhesion.

The model was trained on a comprehensive feature set, including Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and spectral centroids, derived from the RWC Musical Instrument Sound Database. Through controlled manipulation of the β hyperparameter, we achieve a latent space where individual dimensions correspond strongly to orthogonal semantic descriptors (e.g., brightness, roughness, attack sharpness) as validated by correlation with subjective listening tests. We demonstrate the model's generative utility by interpolating between disparate points in the latent space to synthesize novel, perceptually coherent timbres.

The analysis was performed on a corpus of Chopin mazurkas, known for their expressive temporal flexibility. The resulting canonical variates reveal strong, statistically significant correlations linking specific kinematic parameters to acoustic attributes. For instance, we found a primary mode of covariance linking wrist velocity and finger articulation height to note-level staccato and micro-dynamic shaping.

This Hierarchical Gamma Process NMF (HGP-NMF) approach avoids the need for extensive supervised training data. Evaluated on the MedleyDB dataset, our unsupervised method achieves signal separation quality (measured by Signal-to-Distortion Ratio, SDR) competitive with, and in some instrument-class cases superior to, contemporary supervised deep learning architectures.

A subsequent attention layer learns to dynamically weight the importance of each stream for predicting formal boundaries. Evaluated on a large corpus of annotated EDM tracks, our model significantly improves F-scores over single-modality baselines.

The synthesized timbres were controlled for various acoustic features, including inharmonicity, spectral centroid, and spectral irregularity. Using partial least squares regression (PLSR), we modeled the relationship between these timbral features and the stability ratings. The analysis revealed a highly significant predictor: the inherent sensory dissonance of a timbre's partial series, calculated using the Plomp-Levelt model. Timbres with more harmonically consonant partial structures were consistently perceived as more tonally stable, irrespective of their scale degree.

We present a comprehensive experimental characterization of the decoherence dynamics of a transmon qubit strongly coupled to a non-Markovian environment, engineered by coupling the qubit to a high-Q transmission line resonator. By employing a suite of advanced pulse sequences including Ramsey, spin-echo, and the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) sequence, we perform decoherence tomography to reconstruct the spectral density of the environmental noise. The reconstructed spectrum reveals distinct non-Lorentzian peaks corresponding to coherent energy exchange with the resonator modes, a hallmark of non-Markovian behavior.

Here, we investigate the stability of the MBL phase in a one-dimensional disordered spin-1/2 chain with power-law decaying dipolar interactions (1/r^α). Through large-scale exact diagonalization and time-dependent variational principle simulations, we demonstrate that for α < 2, the MBL phase is destabilized, giving way to a subdiffusive thermalizing regime. Crucially, we identify a prethermal regime characterized by Hilbert space fragmentation into dynamically disconnected subspaces, a phenomenon not captured by conventional MBL diagnostics. The fragmentation is governed by emergent conserved quantities related to dipole moment conservation.

We define entanglement complexity via the Fubini-Study metric on the manifold of states reachable through unitary evolution from a reference state. Our analysis reveals that for a thermofield double state dual to a two-sided eternal black hole, the late-time linear growth of complexity is holographically dual to the volume of the Einstein-Rosen bridge. We compute this for Vaidya-AdS spacetimes, demonstrating that the complexity rate precisely captures the shockwave's energy injection into the bulk.

By employing the reaction coordinate mapping technique combined with hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM), we derive a generalized integral fluctuation theorem that explicitly incorporates non-Markovian memory effects and initial system-bath correlations. Our analysis reveals that for specific structured spectral densities, strong coupling can lead to a transient reversal of heat flow, where heat temporarily flows from the colder reservoir to the hotter system without external work, a phenomenon strictly forbidden in Markovian thermodynamics.

By analyzing the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation, we demonstrate that the Page curve is correctly reproduced without requiring spacetime islands. Our resolution stems from the non-local, 'fractionated' nature of degrees of freedom in the strongly coupled CFT. We calculate the entanglement entropy between early and late radiation quanta, modeled as specific operators in the CFT, and show that non-perturbative, multi-trace correlators generate the necessary entanglement structure to purify the radiation after the Page time. This suggests that the information is encoded non-locally in the correlations within the radiating system itself, obviating the need for superluminal information transfer or dramatic modifications to the horizon.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Kuantum,Generated,Resolving the Information Paradox via Non-Local Entanglement Structure in the D1-D5 CFT

This technique decomposes complex textures into a set of additive 'spectral objects' and their temporal activations, which often correspond to distinct instrumental groups. Applying this method to a corpus of works by Richard Strauss and Gustav Mahler, we analyze the statistical properties of these objects, such as spectral centroid and flux, to quantify timbral blending, segregation, and mass.

Unlike deterministic rule-based systems, the rule probabilities are learned directly from a corpus of Palestrina's works using the inside-outside algorithm. This allows the model to capture stylistic tendencies in addition to strict rules. When tasked with generating a new contrapuntal line against a given cantus firmus, the system produces stylistically cogent solutions that largely adhere to traditional pedagogy.

A local, unsupervised Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) rule facilitates rapid adaptation to new tasks, while a novel metaplasticity-regulated synaptic consolidation process protects knowledge from previous tasks. This consolidation mechanism is formulated as a Bayesian filtering problem over synaptic importance weights, selectively reducing the plasticity of synapses deemed critical for past performance. The event-driven and sparse computational nature of SNNs makes this approach highly energy-efficient. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on sequential classification benchmarks like permuted MNIST and sequential CIFAR-100, achieving minimal forgetting without storing explicit task exemplars or requiring task boundaries, marking a significant step towards autonomous lifelong learning agents.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Continual Learning in Neuromorphic Systems via Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity and Synaptic Consolidation
"Computational design of novel protein structures remains a formidable challenge in synthetic biology. We introduce Equivariant Graph GAN (EGGAN), a generative adversarial framework for de novo protein backbone generation that respects the fundamental SE(3) symmetries of 3D space. The generator, a SE(3)-equivariant graph neural network, constructs protein structures residue-by-residue, ensuring that its output distribution is invariant to global rotations and translations. The discriminator, also equivariant, learns a potential energy surface to distinguish between generated and real protein structures from the Protein Data Bank. By conditioning the generator on secondary structure specifications, we guide the generative process towards desired topological folds. Our model generates novel, physically-viable protein structures with realistic bond lengths and angles, demonstrating the capacity to create diverse folds not observed in the training set, thus providing a powerful tool for functional protein engineering.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Equivariant Graph Generative Adversarial Networks for De Novo Protein Structure Design
"Unsupervised learning of disentangled representations is a fundamentally ill-posed problem. We propose a novel framework, the Annealed Hyper-spherical Information Bottleneck VAE (AHIB-VAE), that encourages disentanglement by imposing specific geometric and information-theoretic constraints. Our model incorporates an annealed Total Correlation term in the objective function, gradually enforcing statistical independence among latent variables. Critically, we replace the standard Gaussian prior with a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution, constraining the latent embeddings to a hyper-sphere. This geometric prior discourages the model from relying on axis-aligned variance as an information channel, which we hypothesize is a primary cause of posterior collapse and representation entanglement. Without any supervision on the underlying generative factors, AHIB-VAE achieves state-of-the-art disentanglement scores on benchmark datasets like dSprites and 3D-Shapes, while maintaining high-fidelity reconstructions, thus providing a more principled approach to unsupervised representation learning.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Disentanglement via Annealed Information-Bottleneck VAEs with Hyper-spherical Latent Distributions
"Current multi-modal learning methods often rely on instance-level contrastive objectives, which may fail to capture abstract structural similarities across modalities. We introduce a novel self-supervised framework grounded in category theory. Modalities (e.g., vision, language) are modeled as objects in a category, and intra-modal relationships (e.g., spatial relations in an image) are represented as morphisms. We learn a set of contravariant functors that map these modality-specific categories into a shared, semantically coherent latent space. The training objective minimizes the representational distance between functorially mapped structures, thereby enforcing abstract relational consistency. This approach moves beyond instance discrimination to learn representations that preserve high-order structural information. We demonstrate the superiority of our functorial alignment method on multi-modal tasks such as cross-modal retrieval and visual question answering on the VQA and Flickr30k datasets, achieving robust and generalizable embeddings.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Categorical Functors for Self-Supervised Multi-Modal Representation Learning
"Standard Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithms often falter in complex, real-world search spaces where the objective function's smoothness and noise level vary, violating the assumption of stationarity.

Our HGP uses deep kernel learning to model input-dependent length-scale and noise variance parameters, allowing it to adapt its exploratory behavior across the search space. These hyperparameters are co-inferred efficiently via stochastic variational inference. We derive a novel Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) acquisition function that explicitly accounts for the learned non-stationarity and heteroscedasticity, balancing exploration in uncertain, high-variance regions with exploitation in promising, low-noise areas. We demonstrate substantial improvements in query efficiency and final performance on challenging black-box optimization tasks, including hyperparameter tuning for deep neural networks and automated materials discovery simulations.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Non-Stationary Bayesian Optimization with Heteroscedastic Gaussian Process Priors
"Few-shot anomaly detection in multivariate time-series is critical for industrial monitoring and finance, yet existing methods struggle with high dimensionality and data scarcity. We propose Prototypical Kalman Filters (PKF), a novel meta-learning framework that learns a shared low-dimensional latent space where system dynamics can be effectively modeled. During meta-training on a variety of tasks, a deep autoencoder learns to project time-series segments into this latent space, while a meta-learner simultaneously learns to initialize a linear state-space model (Kalman Filter) from a few examples. For a new few-shot task, a prototypical Kalman Filter is instantiated in the latent space using the support set of normal examples. Anomalies in query sequences are then detected as significant prediction errors, quantified by the Mahalanobis distance in the innovation space. Our method robustly identifies anomalies from as few as five normal examples, outperforming state-of-the-art meta-learning and time-series models on challenging aerospace and ECG datasets.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Prototypical Kalman Filters for Few-Shot Anomaly Detection in High-Dimensional Time-Series
"The genomic architecture underlying rapid adaptation remains a central enigma in evolutionary biology. While de novo mutations are a source of novelty, their contribution to short-term evolutionary rescue is often limited. Here, we investigate the role of cryptic genetic variation (CGV) harbored within natural populations of *Drosophila melanogaster*. Utilizing a combination of experimental evolution under novel thermal stress and whole-genome pooled sequencing (Pool-Seq) across 100 generations, we document substantial, rapid phenotypic shifts. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in recombinant inbred lines derived from ancestral and evolved populations reveals that adaptation was not driven by large-effect novel mutations. Instead, we identify numerous small-effect loci that exhibit significant epistatic interactions, primarily sign epistasis, which were neutral or deleterious in the ancestral environment. Our results demonstrate that environmental perturbation can alter the topology of the genotype-phenotype map, unmasking CGV by resolving pleiotropic constraints and providing the raw material for immediate, polygenic selection.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Epistatic Unmasking of Cryptic Genetic Variation as a Primary Driver of Rapid Phenotypic Evolution
"The evolutionary transition from fin to limb is a hallmark of vertebrate terrestrialization, yet the earliest stages of this transformation remain contentious due to a fragmentary fossil record. We describe a new, exceptionally preserved tetrapodomorph, *Promanica primordialis* gen. et sp. nov., from a previously unexamined Givetian locality. The specimen possesses a mosaic of plesiomorphic and apomorphic characters, including a robust, interlocking pectoral girdle coexisting with unsegmented lepidotrichia. High-resolution synchrotron tomography and Bayesian phylogenetic inference incorporating a novel morphometric matrix place *Promanica* as the sister taxon to all known elpistostegalians. Critically, its endochondral pectoral architecture suggests that key modifications for terrestrial support, such as scapulocoracoid fusion, preceded the digital arch development seen in taxa like *Tiktaalik*. This finding decouples two major suites of characters in the fin-to-limb transition, suggesting a stepwise modular evolution where pectoral reinforcement against substrate pressure was an essential pre-adaptation long before the emergence of autopodial structures.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,A new Middle Devonian Sarcopterygian Elucidates the Pectoral Girdle-Fin Transition in Tetrapodomorphs
"The evolution of morphological novelty is often attributed to modifications in developmental gene regulatory networks (GRNs). We investigated the diversification of head appendages in chelicerates, a process governed by the *Hox* gene network. While the protein-coding sequence of the transcription factor *Deformed* (*Dfd*) is deeply conserved, its expression domain varies significantly. Using comparative ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated enhancer deletions in the spider *Parasteatoda tepidariorum* and the scorpion *Centruroides sculpturatus*, we demonstrate that the neofunctionalization of *Dfd* is driven by the rapid turnover of its cis-regulatory elements. We identified a lineage-specific enhancer in spiders that integrates inputs from gap and pair-rule genes, creating a novel anterior expression boundary. Homologous sequence blocks in scorpions lack this enhancer activity. Our results provide a mechanistic link between cis-regulatory evolution and macroevolutionary changes in body plan, illustrating how topological re-wiring of a conserved GRN can generate profound phenotypic divergence.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Cis-Regulatory Rewiring of a Conserved Transcription Factor Underpins Novelty in Arthropod Cephalic Segmentation
"Evolutionary adaptation on multi-peaked, rugged fitness landscapes often requires traversing fitness valleys, a process poorly explained by sequential fixation models. We developed a Wright-Fisher diffusion model incorporating sign and magnitude epistasis to explore the dynamics of evolutionary rescue. Our simulations reveal that the probability of 'stochastic tunneling'—where a population acquires multiple mutations to cross a valley without fixing intermediate deleterious states—is highly dependent on the underlying epistatic architecture. We demonstrate analytically and computationally that landscapes dominated by sign epistasis (where mutation effects are context-dependent) promote tunneling far more than those with magnitude epistasis alone. Furthermore, the rate of tunneling scales non-linearly with population size and mutation rate, creating critical thresholds for evolutionary rescue. These findings challenge the paradigm of adaptive walks, suggesting that for complex adaptations like antibiotic resistance, the interconnectedness of mutations, rather than their individual effects, dictates evolutionary outcomes.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Stochastic Tunneling and Epistatic Sign Magnitude Determine Evolutionary Trajectories on Rugged Fitness Landscapes
"Resolving the deep phylogenetic relationships at the base of the animal tree of life has been notoriously challenging due to rapid ancient radiations, leading to pervasive gene tree-species tree discordance from incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and hemiplasy. Previous studies using limited gene sets have yielded conflicting topologies, particularly concerning the placement of ctenophores and xenacoelomorphs. Here, we applied a hybrid enrichment strategy targeting over 2,500 ultraconserved elements (UCEs) across a comprehensive taxon set of 150 species, including newly sequenced key lineages. Using coalescent-based species tree methods (e.g., ASTRAL-III) and Bayesian concordance analysis, which explicitly model ILS, we recovered a robustly supported phylogeny. Our results consistently place Ctenophora as the sister group to all other Metazoa, and Xenacoelomorpha as sister to the remaining Bilateria (Nephrozoa). This topology, discordant with many concatenated analyses, highlights the critical importance of accommodating gene tree heterogeneity when reconstructing ancient evolutionary events.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Phylogenomic Resolution of the Metazoan Tree of Life through Coalescent-Based Analysis of Ultraconserved Elements
"The 'Red Queen' hypothesis posits that host-parasite interactions drive relentless, reciprocal adaptation. We investigated this dynamic at the molecular level by examining the coevolution between the primate antiviral protein TRIM5α and the lentiviral capsid (CA). Analyzing extensive population-level sequence data from several macaque species and their endemic simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs), we identified signatures of intense, recurrent positive selection in both genes, evidenced by high dN/dS ratios and significant McDonald-Kreitman tests. Phylogenetic reconstruction of ancestral states reveals a pattern of repeated adaptive substitutions concentrated at the TRIM5α-CA interaction interface. Critically, we find evidence of intralocus conflict within TRIM5α, where residues conferring resistance to one SIV strain create vulnerabilities to another. This genetic trade-off fuels negative frequency-dependent selection, preventing fixation of any single resistance allele and maintaining a polymorphic arms race that perpetuates rapid antagonistic coevolution across the host-pathogen landscape.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Accelerated Antagonistic Coevolution Driven by Intralocus Conflict in a Primate-Lentivirus System
"The persistence of heritable genetic variation in sexually selected male traits, despite strong directional female preference, constitutes the lek paradox. We investigated this problem in the lekking satin bowerbird (*Ptilonorhynchus violaceus*), where female choice is based on complex bower decorations. Using a multi-year, cross-fostering experimental design and quantitative genetic analysis, we partitioned the variance in male trait expression. We found that bower quality, a highly heritable trait, is strongly correlated with male metabolic efficiency and inversely correlated with the accumulation of deleterious mutations in the mitochondrial genome (mitochondrial genetic load). Structural equation modeling shows that the trait is an honest indicator of paternal mitonuclear compatibility. The constant influx of new, conditionally deleterious mitochondrial mutations each generation provides a mechanism to maintain selectable genetic variance in the male trait, thereby resolving the lek paradox by linking the sexual signal to a vast mutational target.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Resolution of the Lek Paradox through Condition-Dependent Expression of a Sexually Selected Trait Linked to Mitochondrial Genetic Load

While previous work identified a few key loci like the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), our network-based approach reveals a pervasive, coordinated reconfiguration of cellular physiology. We identified dozens of subtle but statistically significant shifts in metabolic flux and gene expression modules related to xenobiotic metabolism, oxidative stress response, and cellular energy homeostasis. The adaptive phenotype appears not as a product of a few large-effect genes, but as an emergent property of a buffered and robust system that has been systemically fine-tuned by polygenic selection.

Using serial coalescent modeling and Approximate Bayesian Computation, we reconstructed their demographic history with unprecedented resolution. Our analyses reveal a previously unknown, deep population structure between Siberian and North American clades, with evidence of secondary contact and limited introgression around the Last Glacial Maximum. Following this period, all populations experienced a drastic, asynchronous decline in effective population size (Ne). Critically, we observe a significant increase in the genomic load of deleterious mutations (realized load) in the terminal Wrangel Island population, consistent with purifying selection becoming inefficient in small populations.

"The rapid evolution of multi-drug resistance in pathogenic bacteria is largely driven by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of mobile genetic elements (MGEs). However, the network-level dynamics of these transfers in complex microbial communities remain poorly understood. We employed long-read metagenomic sequencing and Hi-C proximity ligation on samples from a hospital wastewater environment to reconstruct complete plasmid, phage, and integrative conjugative element (ICE) structures. Our analysis revealed a hierarchical and modular architecture of the 'mobilome'. Resistance genes are typically embedded within smaller, non-autonomous transposons or integrons, which are in turn embedded within larger, promiscuous conjugative plasmids and ICEs that act as transfer vectors across phylogenetic boundaries. This nested structure facilitates a highly efficient combinatorial evolution, allowing for the rapid assembly of novel resistance arrays from a shared pool of modular genetic components.

Here, we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the human PRC2-EZH2-Y641F mutant complex bound to a nucleosome substrate. Our structural data reveal an allosteric mechanism whereby the mutation enhances substrate affinity and stabilizes the catalytic SET domain, leading to hyper-trimethylating activity. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and RNA-seq in GBM patient-derived xenografts, we demonstrate that this hyperactivity results in the aberrant silencing of tumor suppressor genes, including CDKN2A.

"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as critical regulators of gene expression, often functioning as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) that sequester microRNAs. Here, we identify and characterize a novel lncRNA, SPONGE-WNT, that is dynamically expressed during human embryonic stem cell differentiation into cortical neurons. We demonstrate that SPONGE-WNT contains multiple, evolutionarily conserved binding sites for miR-29a. Through luciferase reporter assays and Argonaute-2 immunoprecipitation, we confirm a direct physical interaction. Overexpression of SPONGE-WNT effectively sponges miR-29a, leading to the de-repression of its direct target, GSK3β, a key negative regulator of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Consequently, β-catenin phosphorylation is increased, leading to its degradation and attenuation of Wnt signaling, which promotes premature neuronal commitment. Conversely, CRISPRi-mediated knockdown of SPONGE-WNT enhances Wnt signaling and maintains pluripotency markers.

"Cytosine base editors (CBEs) enable precise C-to-T conversions for correcting pathogenic point mutations, but their clinical application is hampered by off-target DNA and RNA deamination. We engineered a novel high-fidelity CBE, termed hf-BE4max, by fusing a rationally designed, high-specificity Cas9-nickase variant (Sniper-Cas9) with an evolved APOBEC3A deaminase domain containing mutations that restrict its activity window and reduce bystander mutations. Whole-genome sequencing and transcriptome-wide analysis confirmed a significant reduction in both DNA and RNA off-target editing in HEK293T cells compared to existing CBE architectures. We applied hf-BE4max to correct the CFTR-R553X nonsense mutation in intestinal organoids derived from a cystic fibrosis patient. Using an optimized lipid nanoparticle delivery system, we achieved up to 40% precise correction of the target cytosine with negligible off-target events.

The molecular chaperone Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90) has been implicated in proteostasis, but its specific role in modulating αSyn aggregation remains unclear. Using a combination of single-molecule fluorescence, NMR spectroscopy, and thioflavin T kinetic assays, we demonstrate that HSP90 directly interacts with monomeric and oligomeric αSyn. This interaction does not prevent fibril formation but instead remodels the aggregation pathway, shunting αSyn into large, off-pathway, non-toxic amorphous aggregates. We show that ATP-dependent conformational cycling of HSP90 is essential for this activity. In primary neuronal cultures, overexpression of HSP90, but not an ATP-hydrolysis-deficient mutant, significantly reduced αSyn-induced cytotoxicity and synaptic dysfunction. Our findings reveal a specific mechanism by which HSP90 mitigates αSyn toxicity by kinetically trapping it in benign aggregated states, identifying a key node in the cellular defense against proteinopathy.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,"HSP90 Chaperone Activity Modulates the Oligomerization Pathway of Alpha-Synuclein, Preventing Formation of Cytotoxic Prefibrillar Species"

Upon TGF-β stimulation, receptor-mediated phosphorylation of SMAD3 promotes its interaction with RNF146. Utilizing in vitro ubiquitination assays, we show that RNF146 directly catalyzes the K48-linked polyubiquitination of phosphorylated SMAD3, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Genetic ablation of RNF146 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts results in sustained SMAD3 activation and prolonged TGF-β transcriptional responses. We further demonstrate a functional crosstalk, where Notch signaling upregulates RNF146 expression. This upregulation leads to the rapid termination of the anti-proliferative TGF-β signal, thereby enabling Notch-induced proliferation and differentiation in a developmental context.

Using single-molecule FRET, we show that DHX36 preferentially binds and unwinds telomeric G4 structures in an ATP-dependent manner. Conditional depletion of DHX36 in human cells leads to a marked increase in G4-associated DNA damage signals (γH2AX foci) specifically at telomeres, as visualized by co-localization with TRF1. DNA fiber analysis revealed a significant reduction in replication fork velocity and an increase in fork stalling events within telomeric regions.

We employed CRAC (UV cross-linking and analysis of cDNAs) to map the binding sites of DDX21 on the 47S pre-rRNA, revealing a primary interaction site within the 5' end of the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1). siRNA-mediated depletion of DDX21 resulted in the accumulation of the 30S pre-rRNA intermediate and a concomitant reduction in 18S rRNA levels, as determined by Northern blotting and metabolic labeling. In vitro processing assays using purified components demonstrate that the ATPase activity of DDX21 is required to remodel the local pre-rRNA structure, facilitating cleavage at site 2 by the U3 snoRNP complex.

"Selective removal of damaged mitochondria via mitophagy is crucial for cellular homeostasis. While the Parkin/PINK1 pathway mediates ubiquitin-dependent mitophagy, alternative mechanisms are less understood. Here we establish that NIX/BNIP3L, a mitochondrial outer membrane protein, functions as a direct, ubiquitin-independent mitophagy receptor. Using high-resolution structural analysis and biochemical reconstitution, we show that the LIR (LC3-interacting region) motif of NIX becomes exposed upon mitochondrial depolarization, facilitating a high-affinity interaction with lipidated LC3-II on the nascent autophagosome. Crucially, in Parkin-deficient cells, hypoxia-induced mitochondrial damage still triggers robust mitophagy that is entirely dependent on NIX expression and its LIR integrity. A mouse model with a NIX-LIR mutation exhibits profound mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiomyopathy, phenocopying the full knockout.

The serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein SRSF1 promotes the selection of the distal 5' splice site, favoring BCL-XL production. Here, we uncover a phosphorylation-based switch that modulates SRSF1 activity. We demonstrate that under genotoxic stress, the kinase CLK1 phosphorylates SRSF1 at specific serine residues within its RNA recognition motif (RRM). This phosphorylation event diminishes the binding affinity of SRSF1 for its cognate exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) in the BCL-X pre-mRNA, as confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and iCLIP-seq. This displacement allows the U1 snRNP to bind the competing proximal 5' splice site, shifting the splicing balance toward the pro-apoptotic BCL-XS isoform. Reversing this phosphorylation through phosphatase treatment or phosphomimetic mutations restores BCL-XL splicing.

The bromodomain protein BRD4 is highly enriched at SEs, but the mechanism for its localized accumulation and functional output remains unclear. Here, we show that the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of BRD4 drives liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), forming biomolecular condensates. Using live-cell single-molecule imaging and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), we observe that BRD4 forms liquid-like droplets at SEs, which exhibit dynamic fusion and fission events. These BRD4 condensates serve as hubs to recruit and concentrate RNA Polymerase II and the Mediator complex, significantly increasing their local concentration. In vitro reconstitution assays confirm that BRD4, acetylated histones, and Mediator are sufficient to form multi-phasic condensates. Perturbation of the BRD4 IDR dissolves these condensates and abrogates the characteristic transcriptional bursting of SE-driven genes like MYC.

The hypernetwork is trained concurrently with the meta-parameters via a bilevel optimization objective, maximizing the outer-loop meta-objective. This allows the model to learn an optimal, non-stationary optimization trajectory for few-shot adaptation. We derive an efficient training algorithm using implicit differentiation to bypass computationally expensive second-order derivatives.

Quantitative evaluations using Fréchet Inception Distance and qualitative assessments by expert radiologists on the BraTS and LIDC-IDRI datasets show that LD-GAN synthesizes images with superior detail and anatomical plausibility compared to state-of-the-art GANs and diffusion models, setting a new benchmark for synthetic medical data generation.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,High-Fidelity Synthesis of Volumetric Medical Images using Latent Diffusion-GANs with 3D-Attention Mechanisms
"Reliable uncertainty estimation is paramount for deploying neural networks in safety-critical applications. We introduce a novel, scalable framework for Bayesian inference in deep neural networks that combines functional priors with amortized variational inference. Traditional Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) often rely on simplistic, factorized priors in weight space, limiting their expressive power. Our method specifies priors directly over the function space using Gaussian Processes, which induces a rich, non-diagonal covariance structure in the weight space. To circumvent the computational intractability of posterior inference, we employ an amortized inference network that learns a direct mapping from data to the parameters of the variational distribution. This avoids costly iterative optimization per data point. Experiments on out-of-distribution detection and regression tasks demonstrate that our model provides better-calibrated and more robust uncertainty estimates than deep ensembles, MC-Dropout, and mean-field BNNs, while maintaining computational efficiency.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Scalable Uncertainty Quantification in Bayesian Neural Networks via Amortized Stochastic Variational Inference with Functional Priors
"We introduce HyperMoco, a self-supervised framework for learning rich node representations from heterogeneous hypergraphs, which capture complex, multi-way relationships between entities of different types. Existing graph contrastive learning methods are designed for pairwise edges and homogeneous nodes, failing to leverage the higher-order and heterogeneous information in hypergraphs. HyperMoco addresses this by creating two distinct, correlated views of the input hypergraph. One view is generated by structural augmentations (e.g., hyperedge masking), while the other is formed through modality-specific feature perturbations. It then maximizes the agreement between these views using a momentum-based contrastive learning objective, which allows for a large dictionary of negative samples without excessive memory requirements. On several real-world heterogeneous hypergraph datasets, pre-training with HyperMoco and fine-tuning on downstream tasks like node classification and link prediction yields new state-of-the-art results, demonstrating its efficacy in capturing complex relational structures.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning on Heterogeneous Hypergraphs via Multi-Modal View Generation
"This work introduces Geodesic Adversarial Training (GAT), a novel defense mechanism that leverages the intrinsic geometry of the data manifold to improve adversarial robustness. Standard adversarial training methods, like PGD, generate perturbations in the ambient Euclidean space, which may not align with the underlying data distribution. In contrast, GAT synthesizes adversarial examples by approximating geodesics on the data manifold, which is locally modeled using a Riemannian metric derived from the Jacobian of the neural network's feature extractor. This forces the model to learn a decision boundary that is robust to more plausible, on-manifold perturbations. We further introduce a manifold-aware regularization term that promotes local isometry, discouraging distortions in the learned feature space. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet demonstrate that GAT significantly enhances robustness against a wide array of white-box and black-box attacks, surpassing state-of-the-art defenses like TRADES and PGD-AT.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Geodesic Adversarial Training: Enhancing Model Robustness through Manifold Regularization
"We propose a hybrid deep learning architecture, the Physics-Informed Spatiotemporal Graph Network (PI-STGN), for accurate and physically consistent long-range climate forecasting. The model represents the Earth's surface as a graph, where nodes are grid points and edges encode dynamic dependencies. It integrates a graph convolutional network (GCN) to capture complex spatial teleconnections and a gated recurrent unit (GRU) to model temporal evolution. The key innovation is the incorporation of a physics-informed loss term that penalizes deviations from known physical laws, such as the conservation of mass and energy, formulated as soft constraints based on discretized partial differential equations (PDEs). This regularization guides the learning process towards physically plausible solutions, mitigating overfitting and improving generalization beyond the training data distribution. Evaluated on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset for forecasting temperature and geopotential height, PI-STGN demonstrates superior skill and physical consistency over purely data-driven baselines and establishes a new benchmark for deep learning-based weather prediction.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Physics-Informed Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Networks for Multi-Step Climate Forecasting
"We introduce a novel continual learning framework, Hebbian-Gated Rehearsal Memory (HGRM), designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in neural networks. Inspired by synaptic plasticity, HGRM utilizes a small, dynamically managed memory buffer for experience rehearsal. A key component is a Hebbian-based gating mechanism that selectively stores samples that are both informative and diverse, thus maximizing the utility of the limited memory budget. This gate prioritizes experiences that induce significant gradient updates, indicative of surprising or novel information. Furthermore, during rehearsal, we employ a task-aware regularization scheme that modulates plasticity based on parameter importance estimates derived from the Fisher Information Matrix, protecting knowledge critical for past tasks. Through extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks like Split-CIFAR-100 and a 5-task CUB-200 sequence, HGRM demonstrates superior performance in knowledge retention and forward transfer compared to leading continual learning methods, including GEM and AGEM, while requiring a smaller memory footprint.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Overcoming Catastrophic Forgetting in Continual Learning via Hebbian-Gated Rehearsal Memory
"Transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes is orchestrated by distal enhancers, yet the mechanism coupling enhancer activity to promoter firing remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the bromodomain protein BRD4 and the Mediator complex subunit MED1 undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) to form transcriptional condensates at super-enhancers. Using super-resolution microscopy and chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), we show these biomolecular condensates are dynamic, spatially distinct nuclear bodies that stabilize enhancer-promoter loops. Perturbation of phase separation via mutagenesis of intrinsically disordered regions in BRD4 abrogates loop stability and diminishes transcriptional output. Furthermore, single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) reveals that condensate formation directly correlates with an increase in transcriptional burst frequency, rather than burst size. Our findings posit that LLPS of key transcriptional coactivators serves as a physical principle for concentrating the transcriptional machinery, thereby tuning the kinetics of gene expression in a stochastic nuclear environment.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation of BRD4 and MED1 Modulates Enhancer-Promoter Looping and Transcriptional Bursting
"CRISPR-based epigenome editing offers a powerful tool for modulating gene expression, but achieving long-term, heritable silencing remains a significant challenge. We have engineered a tripartite fusion effector, dCas9-KRAB-MeCP2, designed to initiate and lock in a silenced chromatin state. The KRAB domain initiates heterochromatin formation via recruitment of KAP1 and SETDB1, leading to H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3). Subsequently, the fused MeCP2 domain binds to the de novo methylated DNA, which is a downstream consequence of the H3K9me3 mark, and recruits histone deacetylase complexes to reinforce a repressive state. Using this system to target the MYC oncogene promoter, we demonstrate robust and durable silencing that persists through multiple cell divisions even after cessation of dCas9-KRAB-MeCP2 expression. ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq analyses confirm progressive heterochromatin spreading from the target locus, establishing a mitotically stable epigenetic memory. This 'initiate-and-lock' strategy provides a novel therapeutic avenue for permanently silencing disease-associated genes.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Durable Silencing of Oncogenic Loci via dCas9-KRAB-MeCP2 Mediated Heterochromatin Spreading
"Cellular adaptation to hypoxia requires rapid proteomic remodeling, much of which is controlled at the level of mRNA translation. To dissect these mechanisms globally, we performed ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) coupled with parallel RNA-seq on human endothelial cells subjected to acute hypoxia. Our analysis revealed a dramatic uncoupling of transcription and translation, with hundreds of mRNAs exhibiting altered translational efficiency. A predominant mechanism of repression was the increased translation of upstream open reading frames (uORFs), which sterically inhibits initiation at the main protein-coding sequence. We identified novel uORF-regulated transcripts critical for cell survival, including the vascular permeability factor ANGPTL4. This regulation is contingent upon GCN2-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2α. These data provide a high-resolution map of the hypoxic translatome and establish uORF-mediated translational control as a pervasive and critical node in the cellular response to oxygen deprivation, offering new targets for modulating ischemic injury.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,System-wide Analysis of Translational Reprogramming During Hypoxic Stress Reveals Pervasive uORF-mediated Regulation
"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as critical architects of nuclear organization. During X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), the lncRNA Xist initiates silencing, but how the inactive X (Xi) establishes its unique compact structure remains unclear. Here, we identify the lncRNA *Firre* as a key structural component that tethers the Xi to the nuclear periphery. Using RNA antisense purification coupled with mass spectrometry (RAP-MS), we show that *Firre* directly interacts with both the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and the inner nuclear membrane protein Lamin B1. Chromosome conformation capture (4C-seq) demonstrates that *Firre* depletion disrupts long-range contacts on the Xi and detaches it from the lamina. Consequently, H3K27me3 marks, deposited by PRC2, are improperly distributed, leading to leaky expression of X-linked genes. Our results reveal *Firre* as a molecular scaffold that physically links chromatin modifiers to a specific nuclear subdomain, thereby defining the spatial topography of facultative heterochromatin.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,The lncRNA Firre Orchestrates X-Chromosome Inactivation Topography by Anchoring the PRC2 Complex to the Nuclear Lamina
"Understanding cell fate decisions during organogenesis requires dissecting the interplay between chromatin accessibility and gene expression at single-cell resolution. We generated a joint single-cell ATAC-seq and RNA-seq dataset from murine embryonic pancreatic tissue to reconstruct the developmental trajectory of islet cell lineages. By integrating these multi-omic modalities, we identified a transient, multipotent progenitor state characterized by broad chromatin accessibility at lineage-specific enhancer elements. Pseudotemporal ordering revealed that commitment to alpha- or beta-cell fates is preceded by changes in the accessibility of distal regulatory elements bound by key transcription factors, including ARX and PDX1, respectively. This epigenomic priming event occurs prior to detectable divergence in the corresponding transcriptomes.

"The choice between non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homology-directed repair (HDR) for DNA double-strand breaks is a critical determinant of genome stability. The protein 53BP1 promotes NHEJ and inhibits end resection, a prerequisite for HDR. Here, we elucidate a molecular switch that antagonizes 53BP1 function. We show that following ATM-mediated phosphorylation of 53BP1 on serine 1778 within its ubiquitination-dependent recruitment motif, the E3 ligase RNF168 is recruited. RNF168 subsequently deposits K63-linked ubiquitin chains directly onto 53BP1. Using in vitro reconstitution and cell-based assays, we demonstrate this ubiquitination sterically hinders the interaction of 53BP1 with its downstream effector RIF1, effectively dismantling the inhibitory complex. This exposes the DNA end, allowing BRCA1 and CtIP to initiate resection and commit the cell to HDR. This phosphorylation-ubiquitination cascade represents a key regulatory node that fine-tunes DNA repair pathway choice based on cell cycle context and chromatin state.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Phosphorylation-dependent Ubiquitination of 53BP1 by RNF168 Governs the NHEJ-to-HDR Switch

Understanding its activation mechanism has been hampered by a lack of high-resolution structural information. Here, we present the 2.8 Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the full-length human GCGR bound to its cognate Gs protein, glucagon, and a novel positive allosteric modulator (PAM), NNC0640. The structure reveals that the PAM binds to a previously unknown cavity at the extracellular-transmembrane interface, distant from the orthosteric peptide-binding site. PAM binding induces a subtle conformational rearrangement in transmembrane helix 6 and 7, which stabilizes the receptor in an active state and enhances Gs-protein coupling efficiency. This allosteric mechanism provides a structural blueprint for designing biased agonists and modulators with improved therapeutic profiles for metabolic diseases.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Cryo-EM Structure of the Class B GPCR Glucagon Receptor in Complex with Gs and a Positive Allosteric Modulator
"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant internal modification on eukaryotic mRNA, dynamically regulating mRNA fate. Its role in tumorigenesis is increasingly apparent but remains mechanistically ill-defined. We investigated the m6A landscape in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and found significant upregulation of the m6A methyltransferase METTL3. By performing m6A-sequencing and integrating it with transcriptome analysis of patient-derived xenografts, we identified a cohort of tumor suppressor transcripts, including PTEN and SOCS2, that are hypermethylated in HCC. Using PAR-CLIP, we show these m6A-marked transcripts are preferentially recognized by the m6A 'reader' protein YTHDF2. This interaction recruits the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex, leading to accelerated mRNA decay. Knockdown of either METTL3 or YTHDF2 in HCC cells restored the stability of these tumor suppressor mRNAs, reduced cell proliferation, and attenuated tumor growth in vivo. Our findings demonstrate that a dysregulated METTL3-YTHDF2 epitranscriptomic axis promotes oncogenesis by destabilizing key anti-cancer transcripts.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Dysregulation of the METTL3-YTHDF2 Axis Accelerates mRNA Decay of Tumor Suppressors in Hepatocellular Carcinoma
"Cullin-RING E3 ligases (CRLs) are the largest family of ubiquitin ligases, responsible for targeting a vast number of proteins for degradation. Their activity must be tightly regulated to prevent spurious ubiquitination. Using quantitative proteomics and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), we uncovered a novel autoinhibitory mechanism within the CRL4 complex containing the substrate receptor DCAF8. We found that binding of a bona fide substrate to DCAF8 induces a significant allosteric conformational change in a C-terminal helix of the receptor itself. This conformational switch weakens the DCAF8-DDB1 interface, decreasing the processivity of the ligase and preventing hyper-ubiquitination of the substrate. Mutating key residues in this C-terminal helix abrogates this feedback, leading to uncontrolled substrate degradation. This work reveals a substrate-centric negative feedback loop that ensures precise temporal control over protein turnover, adding a new layer of complexity to the regulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Autoinhibitory Feedback Loop in the CRL4-DCAF8 E3 Ligase Complex Regulated by Substrate-Induced Conformational Switching
"A subset of cancers maintains telomere length through the Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) pathway, a homology-directed repair mechanism. ALT relies on break-induced replication (BIR), but the molecular machinery that processes complex telomeric DNA structures to enable BIR remains poorly understood. Here, we identify the Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group M (FANCM) helicase as a critical component of the ALT mechanism. We show that FANCM is enriched at telomeres and co-localizes within ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs) specifically during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. Using in vitro helicase assays, we demonstrate that FANCM efficiently resolves G-quadruplex (G4) structures, which are prevalent at telomeres and are potent blocks to DNA replication. Depletion of FANCM in ALT-positive cells leads to increased replication fork stalling, C-circle accumulation indicative of telomeric stress, and eventual cell death. Our findings establish FANCM as a key G4-resolving helicase essential for BIR at telomeres, identifying it as a promising therapeutic target for ALT-dependent cancers.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,The FANCM Helicase Resolves Telomeric G-Quadruplexes to Facilitate Break-Induced Replication in ALT-Positive Cancers

Bayesian species delimitation analyses robustly support the existence of three distinct, deeply divergent lineages previously unrecognized by morphological or mitochondrial markers. Our nuclear phylogeny reveals a pattern of cytonuclear discordance, where pervasive mitochondrial introgression has obscured species boundaries. Coalescent-based modeling indicates that this introgression is ancient and asymmetrical, likely following secondary contact after a period of allopatric divergence. Ecological niche modeling further demonstrates significant divergence in environmental tolerances among the delimited cryptic species, suggesting that ecological specialization has played a crucial role in their maintenance.

Through comparative genomics across 50 avian species, we identified significant expansion and diversification of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) gene family, key components of the innate immune system’s Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs). Codon-based models of evolution revealed pervasive, episodic positive selection acting on specific codons within the extracellular leucine-rich repeat domains of TLR4 and TLR7, regions critical for pathogen recognition. Furthermore, the rate of TLR evolution was positively correlated with haemosporidian parasite prevalence and diversity. These results strongly suggest that parasite-mediated selection is a primary driver of PRR gene family dynamics, shaping the host's capacity to recognize and respond to a diverse parasite community.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Co-evolutionary Arms Race Dynamics Mediated by PRR Gene Family Expansion in an Avian-Haemosporidian System
"The role of phenotypic plasticity in facilitating macroevolutionary innovation remains a central, yet contentious, topic in evolutionary biology. We investigated the link between developmental plasticity and the origin of insect wings using a comparative transcriptomic and functional genomic approach in Neopteran insects. By experimentally manipulating nymphal rearing density, a known plastic trait inducer, we uncovered a conserved gene regulatory network (GRN) involving vestigial (vg) and scalloped (sd) that is environmentally sensitive. Ancestral state reconstruction suggests this plastic response predates the evolution of powered flight. CRISPR-Cas9 knockdowns confirm that key nodes in this GRN are essential for wing pad development and exhibit altered expression profiles under different environmental cues.

We utilized whole-genome resequencing data from populations across a steep salinity gradient to perform genomic cline analysis and identify loci with exceptional patterns of ancestry. Our results pinpoint a narrow genomic region containing the ion-channel-kinase (ICK) gene, which shows a significant excess of ancestry from the halotolerant species within the genome of its salt-sensitive sister taxon. This introgressed haplotype is associated with a strong selective sweep, nearly fixed in high-salinity populations, and functional assays confirm its role in enhanced osmoregulatory capacity.

Bayesian phylogenetic inference based on these ancient protein sequences resolved several long-standing ambiguities in megafaunal systematics, revealing a previously unrecognized sister-group relationship between the North American giant horse and modern Przewalski's horse.

Using deep sequencing time-series data, we quantified the fixation probabilities of de novo mutations conferring low-level resistance. Our results show that while beneficial mutations were prevalent, their fixation was highly stochastic, with a significant proportion lost from the populations despite their positive selection coefficients. We observed the operation of an epistatic ratchet, where the stochastic fixation of initial, slightly deleterious or neutral mutations constrained subsequent evolutionary pathways.

Our phylogenetic analyses reveal that the core components of the pathway arose through a series of ancient gene duplication events. We find compelling evidence for both neofunctionalization, where duplicates acquired novel ligand specificities, and subfunctionalization, where ancestral functions were partitioned among paralogs.

Fine-mapping and genome-wide association studies implicated a polymorphism within the daf-16 gene, a key transcription factor in the Insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) pathway. Allelic replacement experiments confirmed that this polymorphism causally mediates the trade-off: the allele enhancing fecundity simultaneously reduces lifespan and stress resistance.

Codon-based models of evolution (e.g., PAML, HyPhy) detected pervasive positive selection (dN/dS > 1) acting on sites within the mature toxin region, particularly after duplication events. We infer that an initial phase of subfunctionalization, partitioning the ancestral expression pattern across different venom duct regions, was followed by neofunctionalization driven by positive selection. This process generated functional diversity, allowing for the targeting of novel neuromuscular receptors in prey, and exemplifies a 'duplication-divergence-selection' cascade for generating biochemical innovation.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Accelerated Evolution and Functional Divergence of Toxin Gene Families Following Subfunctionalization in Cone Snails
"Disentangling the effects of selection and demography is a central challenge in evolutionary biology. We investigated the genomic basis of local adaptation in the montane grasshopper *Melanoplus montanus* across complex environmental gradients in the Rocky Mountains. Using redundancy analysis (RDA) and latent factor mixed models on a dataset of over 200,000 SNPs from 480 individuals, we identified distinct signatures of polygenic adaptation. We found that a large proportion of genomic variance is significantly associated with environmental variables, primarily minimum winter temperature and summer precipitation. Adaptive loci were broadly distributed across the genome, with small individual effect sizes, consistent with a polygenic architecture. Candidate genes underlying these associations are enriched for functions related to diapause regulation, metabolic rate, and desiccation tolerance. After correcting for isolation-by-resistance, these genotype-environment associations remained significant, providing strong evidence for selection over neutral demographic processes in shaping the species' genomic landscape.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Landscape Genomics Reveals Polygenic Adaptation to Temperature and Aridity Gradients in a Montane Grasshopper
"The prevalence of sexual reproduction despite its inherent costs remains a central paradox in evolutionary biology. Theoretical models suggest that sex accelerates adaptation by combining beneficial mutations and purging deleterious ones. We tested these hypotheses using experimental evolution in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, competing sexual and engineered asexual lineages in a novel, stressful environment. We tracked genome-wide allele frequency trajectories over 500 generations via pooled sequencing. Asexual populations exhibited classic signatures of clonal interference, where multiple beneficial mutations arose in different lineages but competed, slowing the rate of adaptation. In contrast, sexual populations showed more rapid fixation of beneficial mutations. Furthermore, by reconstructing haplotypes, we found evidence for significant negative epistasis among deleterious mutations, which were purged more efficiently by recombination in sexual lines. Our results provide direct empirical support for both the Fisher-Muller and Kondrashov's Hatchet mechanisms, demonstrating that sex provides a crucial advantage in complex adaptive landscapes.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,The Interplay of Clonal Interference and Negative Epistasis Constrains the Evolution of Asexuality in Experimental Yeast Populations
"The predictability of evolution is a fundamental question, revolving around the relative importance of determinism versus historical contingency. We addressed this by initiating 12 replicate adaptive radiations of *Pseudomonas fluorescens* from a single ancestral clone in a spatially structured environment. All populations diversified into wrinkly spreader and smooth morphotypes, representing a convergent adaptation to occupy distinct niches at the air-liquid interface and in the broth phase. However, whole-genome sequencing at multiple timepoints revealed that the genetic solutions underlying this phenotypic convergence were highly variable. While parallel evolution occurred at the gene level (e.g., mutations in the *wsp* operon), the specific mutations were unique to each replicate. Furthermore, the temporal order of mutations in key regulatory pathways created historical contingencies that constrained subsequent evolutionary trajectories and influenced the relative frequencies of the emergent morphotypes. This experiment demonstrates how evolution is a composite of predictable responses to ecological opportunity and stochastic, contingent genetic events.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Historical Contingency and Ecological Opportunity Shape Convergent Adaptive Radiations in a Long-Term Microbial Evolution Experiment
"We investigate the application of Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQEs) to navigate the complex, non-convex loss landscapes of deep neural networks. Traditional stochastic gradient-based optimizers are susceptible to local minima, whereas quantum annealing has shown promise but requires specialized hardware. Our hybrid quantum-classical approach maps the neural network's loss function to a QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization) problem, which is then formulated as an Ising Hamiltonian. A parameterized quantum circuit, or ansatz, is optimized using a classical outer loop to find the Hamiltonian's ground state, corresponding to a global minimum of the loss function. We employ a hardware-efficient ansatz and the SPSA optimizer to update circuit parameters. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our VQE-based optimization strategy discovers superior minima compared to Adam and SGD, yielding models with improved generalization performance.

To address this, we introduce Logic-Tensor Networks (LTNs), a neuro-symbolic framework that integrates first-order logic (FOL) constraints directly into the latent embedding space of transformer architectures. By representing logical predicates and axioms as differentiable functions operating on tensor representations, our framework enforces semantic consistency during both pre-training and fine-tuning. We employ a real-valued fuzzy logic semantics, enabling the model to handle uncertainty and soft constraints. A novel semantic unification algorithm, implemented via attention mechanisms, allows the model to perform multi-hop deductive reasoning over learned symbolic facts. We demonstrate that LTN-augmented LLMs significantly outperform baseline models on tasks requiring robust logical inference, such as commonsense question answering (CSQA) and knowledge base completion, while providing auditable reasoning paths for its conclusions, thereby enhancing model transparency and trustworthiness.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Logic-Tensor Networks for Verifiable Reasoning in Large Language Models

To handle non-IID data distributions across clients, FedARP incorporates a meta-learning based personalization layer, allowing each client to learn a tailored model that adapts a shared global representation. Crucially, we formalize the privacy-utility trade-off using (ε, δ)-Rényi Differential Privacy, applying calibrated Gaussian noise to client updates and providing a tight compositional analysis over communication rounds. Empirical evaluation on diverse benchmarks demonstrates that FedARP maintains high model accuracy under attack scenarios where methods like FedAvg collapse, while achieving superior personalization and certifiable client-level privacy protection compared to existing robust and private FL algorithms.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Byzantine-Robust Federated Learning with Adaptive Personalization and Rényi Differential Privacy

The generator, a hypergraph convolutional network, learns a distribution over valid molecular hypergraphs, while a multi-objective discriminator evaluates candidates on predicted binding affinity, ADMET properties, and synthetic accessibility. To guide the generator towards regions of the chemical space satisfying Pareto-optimal criteria, we integrate a policy gradient reinforcement learning strategy. The generator's objective is augmented with a reward function derived from the discriminator's multi-faceted evaluation.

We introduce a novel framework, Causal-POMDP, that integrates a Structural Causal Model (SCM) of the environment's latent variable structure into the policy evaluation process. By leveraging variational inference and techniques from do-calculus, our method estimates counterfactual state-action values, effectively adjusting for the confounding bias introduced by unobserved variables. This allows for robust policy evaluation from observational data where the behavior policy is correlated with latent environmental states. We demonstrate empirically in simulated healthcare and robotics environments that Causal-POMDP provides significantly more accurate policy value estimates and rankings than traditional importance sampling, doubly robust estimators, and standard model-based RL approaches, enabling more reliable decision-making under partial observability.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Counterfactual Policy Evaluation in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes via Structural Causal Models

Our architecture combines a cycle-consistent adversarial network for image-to-image translation with a mutual information-based regularization loss. This loss explicitly minimizes the statistical dependency between the learned content and style representations, enforcing a robust disentanglement. The segmentation network is trained exclusively on the modality-invariant content space, enabling it to generalize seamlessly to the unlabeled target domain. Extensive experiments on public datasets for brain and abdominal organ segmentation demonstrate that CD-UDA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art UDA techniques by preserving anatomical fidelity, reducing negative transfer, and achieving segmentation accuracy approaching that of fully supervised models.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Disentangled Representation Learning for Cross-Modality Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in Medical Image Segmentation

We propose a Recurrent Surrogate Gradient (RSG) learning algorithm that addresses these issues. Instead of using a fixed heuristic for the derivative of the spiking activation, we model the surrogate gradient as a small, learnable recurrent neural network. This allows the gradient to be dynamically shaped and propagated through both spatial layers and temporal steps, effectively learning the optimal credit assignment for complex spatio-temporal patterns. This mechanism mitigates the vanishing and exploding gradient problems inherent in BPTT for deep SNNs. We demonstrate on challenging neuromorphic datasets, including DVS-Gesture and the Spiking Heidelberg Digits, that RSG-trained deep SNNs achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and enhanced temporal processing capabilities while maintaining low-power event-driven computation.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Spatio-Temporal Credit Assignment in Deep Spiking Neural Networks with a Recurrent Surrogate Gradient

ProtoGML employs a graph neural network (GNN) backbone to learn a powerful embedding function that maps graphs into a metric space. During our episodic meta-training phase, the model learns to construct class prototypes from a small support set of labeled examples and classify query examples based on their proximity to these prototypes. A key innovation is a task-aware attention mechanism that allows the GNN to focus on the most discriminative substructures for each specific few-shot task. We evaluate ProtoGML on multiple benchmark datasets for both few-shot node and graph classification, demonstrating that it significantly outperforms existing GNN fine-tuning strategies and other graph meta-learning approaches, establishing a new state-of-the-art.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Prototypical Graph Meta-Learner for Few-Shot Node and Graph Classification

We propose Mixed-Curvature Graph Convolutional Networks (MCGCNs), a novel architecture that learns a node-specific latent geometry as a product of Euclidean, hyperbolic, and spherical spaces. Our model performs parallel message passing using geodesic convolutions native to each geometry and employs a learnable gating mechanism to dynamically aggregate these multi-curvature representations. This allows MCGCNs to adaptively capture tree-like hierarchies (hyperbolic) and cyclical structures (spherical) within a single graph, overcoming the representational limitations of fixed-curvature models. We formulate operations within the framework of Riemannian geometry and derive a stable optimization procedure.

We propose AdaPre-SGLD, an adaptive preconditioning method that significantly improves sampling in high-dimensional parameter spaces. Our method maintains a low-rank approximation of the Fisher Information Matrix, which serves as a preconditioning matrix to rescale the stochastic gradient updates and inject anisotropic, curvature-aware noise. This transforms the challenging posterior geometry into a more tractable one, accelerating convergence and improving mixing. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating faster convergence rates for AdaPre-SGLD under standard assumptions.

Pitch events are represented as nodes, and their relationships are encoded as edges weighted by music-theoretic principles of consonance, dissonance, and voice leading. The model employs a multi-head attention mechanism to learn dependencies across different structural levels, from foreground diminutions to the background Ursatz. By training on a curated corpus of expert analyses, our HA-GNN learns to infer prolongational hierarchies and generate complete Schenkerian graphs that are structurally coherent and theoretically plausible.

By analyzing recordings of triadic progressions performed on various instruments, we map harmonic trajectories as paths within these timbral manifolds. Our findings reveal that canonical neo-Riemannian operations (P, L, R) correspond to statistically significant, classifiable geometric transformations within the learned timbral space. This suggests a psychoacoustic coupling between perceived timbral evolution and abstract harmonic syntax, providing an empirical basis for theories of timbre-function and offering a new, multi-modal perspective on harmonic analysis.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Timbral Isomorphisms: Mapping Spectro-Temporal Manifolds to Neo-Riemannian Transformational Spaces

We then employ a Bayesian inference model with nested sampling to evaluate the posterior probability of various competing tuning system hypotheses, including different equal temperaments, just intonation ratios, and adaptive intonation models. The model intrinsically handles performance-related pitch deviations and instrumental inharmonicity by treating them as nuisance parameters. We validate our method on a diverse dataset of synthetic and real-world recordings, demonstrating its superior accuracy in identifying complex and hybrid tuning structures compared to methods based on simple pitch-class histogramming.

"State-of-the-art audio source separation models are often agnostic to the musical syntax governing the sources they aim to separate. This paper introduces a novel framework for polyphonic voice separation that integrates music-theoretic constraints directly into the optimization process. Our model, based on a modified Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) architecture, jointly optimizes for two objectives: the accurate reconstruction of the mixed spectrogram and the contrapuntal validity of the separated melodic streams. The contrapuntal cost function penalizes musically implausible results, such as parallel octaves and fifths, unresolved dissonances, and excessive voice crossing, based on a differentiable model of species counterpoint. This hybrid approach regularizes the ill-posed separation problem, leading to a significant reduction in inter-source interference and producing separated voices that are more melodically coherent and faithful to the principles of polyphonic composition. The method shows marked improvement over baseline NMF and deep learning models, especially in dense contrapuntal textures like those found in Baroque fugues.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,A Contrapuntally-Informed Source Separation Algorithm using Joint Optimization of Spectral and Music-Theoretic Constraints

For a given combination of instrumental audio signals, the model first performs a spectral analysis on the Equivalent Rectangular Bandwidth (ERB) scale to simulate the frequency resolution of the human cochlea. It then applies a computational model of simultaneous masking, calculating the masking threshold exerted by each instrument's spectrum on the others. We define a 'Timbral Integration Index' based on the degree of mutual masking and spectral overlap within critical bands. This index provides a quantitative measure of perceptual blend. Validated against perceptual ratings from expert listeners and classical orchestration treatises (e.g., Rimsky-Korsakov), our model accurately predicts well-blended instrumental pairings versus those that exhibit perceptual segregation, providing a powerful analytical tool for composers and musicologists.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Computational Modeling of Orchestral Blending and Masking: A Psychoacoustically-Informed Approach using Equivalent Rectangular Bandwidth Analysis

Crucially, the encoder is jointly conditioned on a vector of analytical features, including pitch-class set complexity metrics (e.g., Forte's R0, R1, R2), dissonance measures, and modal centricity. By fixing the content variable and traversing specific axes in the conditioned latent space, we can regenerate the input audio while systematically manipulating its harmonic and tonal characteristics.

We then use this trained model to analyze highly chromatic excerpts from late-Romantic and early 20th-century repertoires. At each harmonic event, we compute two information-theoretic metrics: the Shannon entropy of the model's predictive distribution, quantifying tonal ambiguity, and the surprisal (negative log probability) of the observed harmony, quantifying harmonic unexpectedness. The resulting time-series data provides a dynamic, quantitative profile of the music's information content.

Super-resolution microscopy and FRAP experiments reveal that Axin molecules are highly dynamic within these biomolecular condensates. Crucially, mutations that disrupt Dvl3's ability to phase separate abolish its capacity to stabilize β-catenin and activate downstream transcription.

"DNA inter-strand crosslinks (ICLs) are highly cytotoxic lesions whose repair is orchestrated by the Fanconi Anemia (FA) pathway. The FAN1 nuclease plays a critical late-stage role in incising the DNA backbone flanking the ICL. We present the 3.0 Å cryo-EM structure of dimeric human FAN1 bound to an ICL-mimicking DNA substrate. The structure reveals that FAN1 forms a head-to-tail dimer that extensively encircles the DNA, inducing a sharp ~90° bend at the crosslink site.

"Translational dynamics are profoundly influenced by codon usage and tRNA availability, but how this is regulated under stress is unclear. Using ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) in yeast exposed to oxidative stress, we identified robust, codon-specific ribosome pausing at AAA and CAA lysine codons. This pausing was not correlated with cognate tRNA abundance but was linked to the hypomodification of the wobble uridine (U34) in tRNA-Lys-UUU, as quantified by mass spectrometry. We demonstrate that the radical S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) enzyme, Elp3, responsible for the mcm5s2U34 modification, is inactivated by oxidative damage, leading to unmodified tRNAs that are less efficient at decoding. This transient pausing selectively reduces the synthesis of proteins enriched in lysine, including numerous glycolytic enzymes, thereby facilitating a rapid metabolic reprogramming. Our study reveals a direct link between tRNA modification status and codon-specific translational control, representing a swift and elegant mechanism for adapting the proteome to environmental stress.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Ribosome Profiling Uncovers Codon-Specific Translational Pausing Modulated by tRNA Hypomodification in Response to Oxidative Stress

Standard GKP error correction protocols are typically optimized for Gaussian noise. However, many dominant error channels, like single-photon loss in superconducting cavities, are inherently non-Gaussian and biased. We introduce a novel decoding scheme based on a non-linear, adaptive filtering algorithm that significantly outperforms standard decoders in the presence of photon-loss noise. By optimizing the GKP stabilizer measurements and subsequent correction operations for this biased noise model, we demonstrate a substantial increase in the break-even threshold for logical qubit lifetimes.

Our scheme injects a two-mode squeezed vacuum state into a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, where one ancillary mode undergoes a non-deterministic, number-resolving catalysis operation conditioned on a specific photon number detection. We show that the quantum Fisher information of the resulting state scales as N^4, leading to a phase sensitivity scaling of 1/N^2 for a successful catalysis event, where N is the mean photon number of the initial state.

"Performing online Bayesian inference in complex, non-linear state-space models is computationally demanding. Sequential Monte Carlo methods can suffer from particle degeneracy, while MCMC is often too slow. We propose Amortized Stein Variational Gradient Descent (ASVGD), a scalable algorithm for sequential inference that synergizes the particle-based optimization of Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) with the efficiency of amortized inference. A recurrent neural network is trained to propose a variational distribution by mapping the history of observations to the distribution's parameters. At each time step, a set of particles initialized from this proposal is refined via a few SVGD update steps, which deterministically transport the particles to better approximate the true posterior by minimizing the Kernelized Stein Discrepancy. This amortized initialization substantially accelerates convergence. We provide theoretical guarantees on the particle system's behavior and demonstrate empirically on challenging filtering problems that ASVGD achieves higher log-likelihoods and more accurate state estimation than competing VI and SMC methods.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,Amortized Stein Variational Gradient Descent for Sequential Bayesian Inference
"In survival analysis with competing risks, directly modeling the cumulative incidence function (CIF) offers greater interpretability than modeling cause-specific hazards, but existing methods are ill-suited for high-dimensional settings. We propose a two-stage regression framework based on jackknife pseudo-values of the CIF. In the first stage, a non-parametric Aalen-Johansen estimator is used to compute the CIF for each event type. In the second stage, pseudo-values are generated and employed as the response variable in a penalized regression model, such as the LASSO or elastic net, enabling simultaneous variable selection and effect estimation. This approach circumvents the restrictive proportional hazards assumption of cause-specific models and directly quantifies covariate effects on the marginal event probability. We establish the asymptotic properties of the estimators, including oracle inequalities for variable selection under high-dimensional sparsity. Simulation studies and an application to a cancer genomics dataset validate the method's superior selection and estimation performance.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,Pseudo-value Regression for Direct Modeling of the Cumulative Incidence Function with High-Dimensional Covariates
"Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) in the presence of unmeasured confounding is a central challenge in causal inference. We develop a novel semiparametric framework for estimating the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) function using instrumental variables (IV). Our approach is founded on the construction of an orthogonal score function for the CATE parameter, which makes the final estimator first-order insensitive to regularization biases in non-parametric nuisance function estimates. The method leverages flexible machine learning algorithms to estimate these nuisance components—including conditional expectations and propensity scores—and then computes a debiased CATE estimate by solving the orthogonal moment equations. We derive the efficient influence function for the CATE in the IV setting and demonstrate that our estimator is asymptotically normal and semiparametrically efficient. The resulting CATE estimates are robust to machine learning errors, and we provide a method for constructing uniform confidence bands, advancing rigorous personalized inference from observational data.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,Orthogonal Score-Based Semiparametric Inference for Personalized Treatment Effects with Instrumental Variables
"Classical functional data analysis (FDA) assumes data reside in a Euclidean vector space, an invalid premise for data constrained to non-linear spaces like symmetric positive-definite matrices or spheres. We introduce a comprehensive framework for Fréchet regression with functional data whose values are points on a Riemannian manifold. Our model defines the conditional Fréchet mean of the manifold-valued response as a geodesic path parameterized by scalar covariates. Estimation proceeds by minimizing the sum of squared geodesic distances between the observed and fitted values. We develop a computationally tractable algorithm based on tangent space projections; it iteratively alternates between using the logarithmic map to project data onto a tangent space, performing linear estimation, and using the exponential map to project results back to the manifold. We derive the asymptotic properties, including consistency and convergence rates, of the estimated geodesic regression curve under appropriate geometric conditions, and showcase its utility by modeling diffusion tensor brain imaging data.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,Fréchet Regression for Functional Data on Riemannian Manifolds
"Estimating large-scale Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models is hampered by the curse of dimensionality. We propose a hierarchical Bayesian framework for sparse VAR estimation and Granger causal network inference in high-dimensional time series. The methodology centers on a continuous spike-and-slab prior imposed on the VAR coefficients, which induces sparsity and facilitates adaptive shrinkage, pulling negligible coefficients towards zero while preserving influential ones. Crucially, this prior is structured hierarchically to enable group-wise variable selection, directly testing for Granger causality from one entire time series to another, a key objective in multivariate time series analysis. This approach provides direct posterior inclusion probabilities for both individual coefficients and Granger causal links. We establish posterior consistency for parameter estimation and network structure recovery under sparsity assumptions. Comparisons with penalized likelihood methods on simulated and macroeconomic data demonstrate superior performance in both forecasting and network reconstruction.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,Sparse Vector Autoregression with Granger Causal Structure Learning via a Hierarchical Bayesian Prior

Here, we employ whole-genome sequencing and phylogenomic inference to dissect the relationships within the cryptic species complex of the green anole, Anolis carolinensis. Our analysis, leveraging both concatenation and multispecies coalescent methods, reveals profound cytonuclear discordance. While mitochondrial DNA supports a clear geographic clade structure, nuclear phylogenies exhibit widespread topological incongruence. D-statistics and related ABBA-BABA tests provide robust evidence for historical introgression, particularly at ecological transition zones. We argue that reticulate evolution, rather than ILS alone, is the predominant force shaping genomic variation in this group.

Through comparative ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq analyses across multiple species, we identified a novel, lineage-specific cis-regulatory element (CRE) adjacent to the aristaless-like homeobox gene, Alx1. This CRE exhibits strong enhancer activity exclusively in developing wing scale progenitor cells. Functional validation using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated deletion of the enhancer results in a complete loss of iridescent scale morphology, reverting to the ancestral, non-iridescent state without affecting other pleiotropic functions of Alx1. Our results demonstrate that the co-option of a pleiotropic developmental gene for a novel function was mediated not by changes in the coding sequence, but by the de novo evolution of a modular enhancer, providing a compelling case study of cis-regulatory evolution driving morphological innovation.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Cis-Regulatory Evolution of a Novel Enhancer Drove the Origin of a Key Morphological Innovation in Lepidoptera

We investigated the genomic basis of high-altitude adaptation in a community of Andean passerine birds, identifying a shared, non-coding haplotype upstream of the EGLN1 gene, a key regulator of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway. Using phased whole-genome data, we demonstrate that this haplotype originated in a high-altitude specialist species and subsequently introgressed into several recently diverged, colonizing congeners. The introgressed haplotype is associated with enhanced hemoglobin-oxygen affinity and lies within a region of exceptionally high population differentiation (FST) and reduced nucleotide diversity, consistent with a hard selective sweep. This study provides strong evidence for adaptive introgression as a mechanism for rapid environmental adaptation, illustrating how gene flow can circumvent the slower process of de novo mutation in response to strong ecological selection pressures.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Adaptive Introgression of a High-Altitude Hypoxia-Response Allele in Andean Passerines

We analyzed the genomic architecture of Brassica rapa, a species with a well-characterized paleopolyploidy event. Our integrated analysis of genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic data reveals that a significant fraction of retained ohnologs have diverged in their expression patterns due to the insertion of proximal transposable elements (TEs). We demonstrate that these exapted TEs, particularly LTR retrotransposons, introduce novel transcription factor binding sites, effectively rewiring the cis-regulatory landscape and creating new connections within the GRN. This TE-mediated neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization of duplicated genes appears to be a critical, predictable mechanism for resolving genetic redundancy and facilitating evolutionary innovation in the aftermath of polyploidization, contributing substantially to the diversification of angiosperms.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Transposable Element Exaptation as a Primary Driver of Gene Regulatory Network Rewiring Following Paleopolyploidy in Brassica

We conducted a long-term chemostat experiment with Escherichia coli and its lytic bacteriophage T4, collecting time-series genomic data from both populations over 1,000 generations. Our analysis reveals recurrent, reciprocal selective sweeps targeting host cell surface receptors and phage tail fiber proteins, respectively. We observed patterns consistent with negative frequency-dependent selection, where rare host and phage genotypes exhibit a transient fitness advantage. Furthermore, we tracked the dynamic evolution of the host's CRISPR-Cas loci, which rapidly incorporated phage-derived spacers, followed by the emergence of phage escape mutants. This high-resolution genomic time-series provides a direct observation of the molecular arms race, confirming the central tenets of antagonistic coevolution and quantifying the tempo and mode of adaptation in a tightly coupled biotic interaction.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Reciprocal Antagonistic Coevolution Manifested in Time-Series Genomes of a Bacteriophage and its Host

Using paleogenomic data retrieved from well-preserved mammoth specimens spanning the Late Pleistocene, we reconstructed the functional olfactory receptor (OR) gene repertoire of this extinct lineage. By comparing the mammoth OR repertoire to those of extant elephants, we identified a significant expansion in a specific OR subfamily associated with the detection of herbaceous plant volatiles, alongside a contraction of subfamilies related to fruiting plants. The rate of pseudogenization in certain OR genes correlates with paleoclimatic data, suggesting a dynamic response to shifting floral communities during glacial-interglacial cycles.

"The structure of genetic pleiotropy is a critical determinant of evolutionary trajectories, yet its role in constraining adaptation remains difficult to quantify. We employed a deep mutational scanning approach to measure the fitness effects of thousands of mutations in the essential transcription factor HAP4 across diverse environmental conditions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This allowed us to construct a high-dimensional, empirical fitness landscape. We found pervasive antagonistic pleiotropy, where mutations beneficial in one environment were frequently deleterious in others. By simulating adaptive walks on this landscape, we demonstrate that pleiotropic constraints severely limit the number of accessible evolutionary pathways, often trapping populations on suboptimal fitness peaks. The degree of constraint was directly proportional to the dimensionality of the environment. Our results empirically validate the theoretical prediction that pleiotropy is a powerful conservative force in evolution, channeling adaptation along specific, genetically-determined paths and shaping the reproducibility of evolutionary outcomes.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Quantifying Pleiotropic Constraints on the Adaptive Walk of Saccharomyces cerevisiae on a Complex Fitness Landscape
"Rapid evolutionary radiations often produce complex patterns of genomic variation that are difficult to interpret with standard phylogenetic methods. In this study, we analyze a dataset of over 2,000 ultraconserved elements (UCEs) from a recent, rapid radiation of South American flycatchers (Tyrannidae). Traditional concatenation-based phylogenies yield poorly supported nodes and conflicting topologies. To resolve this, we implemented multispecies coalescent network (MSCN) models, which simultaneously estimate species relationships and reticulation events. Our results indicate that while incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) is pervasive across the genome, a significant portion of the observed phylogenetic incongruence is better explained by post-speciation gene flow, particularly between sympatric sister lineages. The MSCN framework identifies specific 'admixture edges' with high posterior probability.

We investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying this process using the butterfly Bicyclus anynana, which exhibits a temperature-induced wing pattern polyphenism. By combining experimental evolution under constant high-temperature selection with whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, we tracked changes in DNA methylation and genetic variation. Initially, the novel phenotype was associated with altered methylation patterns in cis-regulatory regions of key developmental genes, acting as an epigenetic scaffold. Over subsequent generations of selection, we observed the accumulation of SNPs and small indels within these same differentially methylated regions (DMRs), which eventually stabilized the phenotype even in the absence of the environmental cue. Our findings provide strong molecular evidence that heritable epigenetic variation can precede and guide genetic changes, facilitating the canalization of ancestrally plastic traits and offering a mechanistic basis for genetic assimilation.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Epigenetic Scaffolding and Genetic Assimilation: The Role of DNA Methylation in the Evolution of a Temperature-Induced Polyphenism

Our analysis reveals a strong pattern of phylosymbiosis, where the structure of the microbial consortium mirrors the host's population genetic structure across a broad geographic range. We reconstructed metabolic pathways for the entire holobiont, identifying critical metabolic handoffs and co-dependencies, particularly in nutrient cycling and stress-response pathways. Under thermal stress, coordinated shifts in gene expression were observed between the coral host and specific bacterial and archaeal symbionts, suggesting a functionally integrated response.

"The precise orchestration of gene expression during cellular differentiation depends on the dynamic remodeling of chromatin. While long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are implicated in this process, their specific mechanisms remain largely elusive. Here, we identify LncRNA-SPATIAL, a nuclear-retained transcript essential for mesodermal specification. Using chromatin isolation by RNA purification (ChIRP-seq) and Hi-C, we demonstrate that LncRNA-SPATIAL directly binds to both the BAF chromatin remodeling complex and specific distal enhancer elements. Its depletion abrogates BAF recruitment, leading to failed enhancer-promoter looping and the collapse of local topological-associated domain (TAD) architecture. Consequently, key mesodermal transcription factors like T-box and MESP1 fail to activate. Our findings reveal a model where a lncRNA acts as a structural scaffold, physically tethering epigenetic machinery to target loci to poise them for rapid transcriptional activation, thereby ensuring fidelity in cell fate decisions. This architectural role highlights a fundamental principle of lncRNA-mediated control over the three-dimensional epigenome.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,LncRNA-SPATIAL scaffolds the BAF complex to distal enhancers for lineage-specific gene poising
"Cytosine base editors (CBEs) enable precise C•G-to-T•A conversions in genomic DNA but can suffer from off-target deamination and undesirable bystander mutations within the editing window.

Using deep mutational scanning of the UGI protein interface, we identified variants that exhibit dramatically increased binding affinity for uracilated DNA, effectively shielding the edited base from repair pathways without compromising on-target efficiency. Comprehensive, unbiased whole-genome sequencing of edited cell populations demonstrated a >50-fold reduction in Cas9-independent off-target mutations compared to existing CBE architectures.

"Transcription factors often contain intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), but their functional contributions to gene regulation are poorly understood. We show that the N-terminal IDR of the B-cell transcription factor EBF1 mediates liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), forming biomolecular condensates at target super-enhancers. In vitro reconstitution assays combined with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) in vivo demonstrate that these EBF1 condensates are liquid-like and highly dynamic. Deletion or mutation of key aromatic residues within the IDR abrogates phase separation, prevents stable association with super-enhancers, and disrupts transcriptional bursting of target genes. Furthermore, we find that the stoichiometry of EBF1 and its cofactor, RUNX1, modulates the material properties of the condensate, suggesting that regulatory hubs can be fine-tuned.

"Cells respond to diverse stresses by activating the Integrated Stress Response (ISR), characterized by the phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α). While this is known to cause global translation attenuation, the mechanisms governing the selective translation of stress-response mRNAs remain unclear. Employing ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) across multiple stress paradigms, we uncovered a conserved translational reprogramming signature. We found that transcripts containing specific upstream open reading frames (uORFs) with suboptimal Kozak sequences are preferentially translated under ISR activation. This selective translation is not solely dependent on uORF presence but also on codon optimality within the main coding sequence. Computational modeling and polysome profiling validation show that phosphorylated eIF2α-GTP-tRNAi ternary complex limitation creates a kinetic bottleneck, allowing ribosomes to bypass inhibitory uORFs on specific transcripts.

"Telomere attrition eventually triggers a DNA damage response (DDR) that can lead to either cellular senescence or apoptosis. We investigated the molecular events at critically short telomeres by focusing on the CST (CTC1-STN1-TEN1) complex, a key replisome component and telomere-capping factor. We demonstrate that the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase, a central DDR transducer, directly phosphorylates CTC1 and STN1 on multiple serine residues upon telomere deprotection. Using phosphomimetic mutants, we show that this phosphorylation event is a molecular switch that inhibits the fill-in synthesis activity of Polα-primase, promoting excessive 3' overhang resection by the EXO1 nuclease. This altered processing generates a substrate for aberrant homologous recombination, leading to the telomere fusions characteristic of replicative crisis. Our findings elucidate a critical mechanism whereby the DDR, when activated at telomeres, paradoxically promotes genomic instability by coopting and functionally altering a canonical DNA replication and protection complex.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,ATM-dependent phosphorylation of CST complex components dictates telomeric overhang processing during replicative crisis

"The transition from neural progenitors to mature neurons requires a profound remodeling of the cellular transcriptome, driven largely by alternative splicing (AS). The RNA-binding protein PTBP1 is a well-known repressor of neuronal AS programs in non-neuronal cells. Here, we demonstrate its paralog, PTBP2, functions not as a simple replacement but as an active orchestrator of a secondary, neuron-specific splicing cascade. Using iCLIP-seq and deep RNA-seq in differentiating cortical neurons, we show that downregulation of PTBP1 allows for the inclusion of a poison exon in PTBP2 pre-mRNA, leading to a controlled switch in their expression. Newly expressed PTBP2 then targets a distinct set of pre-mRNAs, including those encoding critical synaptic scaffolding proteins and ion channels.

Our proof departs from the purely additive combinatorial approach and instead leverages tools from nilpotent harmonic analysis and the theory of Mal'cev bases for discrete nilpotent groups.

The proof is non-constructive and relies on the well-quasi-ordering of matroids of bounded branch-width, a result stemming from the Robertson-Seymour graph minors project. The core of the argument involves showing that any minor-minimal non-k-regular matroid must have a highly structured and rigidly connected internal representation, which limits its complexity.

"This work generalizes the concept of Sturmian words to higher dimensions by studying the combinatorial properties of discrete planes. We define a d-dimensional word as balanced if the counts of any factor of a given shape differ by at most one throughout the word. We prove that a d-dimensional word is balanced if and only if it arises as a coding of a d-dimensional irrational hyperplane rotation. The proof relies on constructing a substitution rule on a multi-dimensional alphabet which is derived from the continued fraction expansion of the hyperplane's normal vector. This establishes a direct analogue of the classical characterization of Sturmian words. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the complexity function, which counts the number of distinct rectangular blocks of size n_1 x ... x n_d, is given by n_1...n_d + 1, thus resolving a conjecture on the complexity of aperiodic tilings with minimal combinatorial complexity.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Matematik,Generated,Balanced Words and Tilings: The Structure of Multi-dimensional Sturmian Sequences
"We analyze the strength of the Chvátal-Gomory (CG) closure for the set covering problem. Let P be the standard linear programming relaxation of the set covering polytope, and let P_1 be its first CG closure. We construct an infinite family of set covering instances for which the integrality gap of P_1 is Ω(log n), where n is the number of elements in the ground set. This matches the known upper bound and proves that a single round of CG cuts is no more effective in the worst case than the original LP relaxation for approximating the integer optimum. The construction is probabilistic, based on a random hypergraph model where edges correspond to variables. The analysis requires a delicate application of the Lovász Local Lemma to demonstrate the existence of a fractional vertex in P_1 that is far from the integer hull, thereby establishing the lower bound on the gap. This result settles the question of the one-round efficacy of CG cuts for this fundamental problem.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Matematik,Generated,On the Integrality Gap of the Chvátal-Gomory Closure for the Set Covering Polytope

Utilizing a separable mode expansion and a KSW estimator, we perform a high-resolution analysis on simulated CMB temperature and polarization maps, mimicking data from the Planck satellite and future CMB-S4 experiments. Our analysis reveals that anisotropic non-Gaussianity induces unique off-diagonal correlations in the harmonic-space bispectrum. We establish that these signatures can effectively break degeneracies between different inflationary models, particularly distinguishing between single-field slow-roll and multi-field curvaton scenarios.

Utilizing large-scale Monte Carlo simulations employing a cluster-based Swendsen-Wang algorithm, we analyze the system's thermodynamics for q > 2. The introduction of quenched disorder fundamentally alters the phase transition, which, according to the Harris criterion, is expected for systems with a positive specific heat exponent. Through a rigorous finite-size scaling analysis of the magnetic susceptibility and Binder cumulant, we demonstrate that the transition for q ≤ 4 remains second-order but migrates to a new, disorder-controlled universality class, distinct from the pure model. For q > 4, where the pure system exhibits a first-order transition, sufficient disorder softens the transition to a continuous one.

We demonstrate that eccentricity significantly amplifies the power radiated in higher-order modes, such as (l, |m|) = (3,3), (4,4), and (2,1). By performing Bayesian parameter estimation on simulated signals injected into synthetic detector noise for LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, we show that including these modes is crucial for unbiased recovery of source parameters.

By solving the tight-binding Hamiltonian for this system, we demonstrate the existence of a complete photonic bandgap hosting topologically protected, chiral edge states. These states facilitate robust, backscatter-immune propagation of light along the perimeter of the array, even in the presence of significant structural disorder and defects. We calculate the Chern number for the bulk photonic bands, confirming the non-trivial topology of the system.

Using large-scale numerical simulations, we explore the phase diagram as a function of particle density and activity. We find that the viscoelastic nature of the medium significantly alters the onset and characteristics of motility-induced phase separation (MIPS).

Employing a Floquet-Born-Markov approach, we compute the full probability distribution of work performed on the system over many driving cycles. The analysis reveals that quantum coherence, induced by the driving protocol, contributes a non-classical component to the dissipated heat, leading to deviations from the standard Jarzynski and Crooks relations. For a paradigmatic model of a driven two-level system, we demonstrate that these quantum effects are most pronounced in the low-temperature, strong-driving regime.

The homomorphic encryption scheme ensures that the central server can aggregate encrypted gradients without decrypting them, providing robust privacy guarantees against server-side threats. Concurrently, our adaptive quantization algorithm dynamically adjusts the bit-width for gradient compression based on channel conditions and gradient variance, significantly reducing the communication bottleneck. Theoretical analysis establishes convergence guarantees for non-IID data distributions under standard convexity assumptions.

Unlike conventional graph neural networks that are limited to pairwise relationships, HADS explicitly models multi-way interactions by constructing a heterogeneous hypergraph from diverse data sources, including chemical structures, protein-protein interaction networks, and gene expression profiles. The core of our model is a dual-level attention mechanism: an intra-hyperedge attention module weighs the importance of nodes within a given multi-modal interaction, and an inter-hyperedge attention module aggregates information across different synergistic pathways.

"Learning disentangled representations that align with the true causal factors of data generation is a fundamental step towards robust and generalizable machine learning models. We introduce the Interventional Variational Autoencoder (I-VAE), a deep generative model that learns to separate causal variables from observational data without requiring explicit interventional labels. The I-VAE is built upon a structural causal model (SCM) prior and leverages a novel objective function that combines the standard evidence lower bound (ELBO) with a causal disentanglement regularizer. This regularizer encourages the latent space to be structured such that small, localized perturbations correspond to interventions on single causal factors (a soft-do-operation). We demonstrate theoretically that under identifiable conditions, the I-VAE can recover the underlying causal graph structure up to its Markov equivalence class. Empirically, on both synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks, our model successfully disentangles causal mechanisms and demonstrates superior performance in downstream counterfactual reasoning tasks compared to state-of-the-art disentanglement methods.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Disentangling Causal Factors from Observational Data via Interventional Variational Autoencoders
"Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to the deployment of deep neural networks in safety-critical applications. While numerous defenses have been proposed, many lack formal robustness guarantees. Randomized smoothing is a scalable technique that provides high-probability certified robustness, but its effectiveness is often limited by the high-dimensional geometry of the input space. We introduce Manifold-based Randomized Smoothing (MRS), a novel certified defense that operates on a low-dimensional data manifold learned by a generative model. By applying Gaussian smoothing in the latent space of a pre-trained variational autoencoder and propagating the resulting distribution through the decoder, MRS achieves significantly larger certified radii in the ambient input space. We provide a rigorous theoretical framework for deriving these certifications and demonstrate that MRS is agnostic to the downstream classifier architecture.

"Meta-learning aims to develop models that can rapidly adapt to new tasks from limited data. However, conventional gradient-based meta-learners often yield point estimates, neglecting the uncertainty crucial for decision-making in low-data regimes. We propose Bayesian Amortized Meta-Learning (BAML), a probabilistic framework that learns a posterior distribution over task-specific model parameters. BAML employs a hyper-network, trained via amortized variational inference, to directly map a task's support set to the approximate posterior parameters (e.g., mean and covariance) of a target network's weights. This amortization strategy enables efficient, feed-forward adaptation to new tasks at meta-test time, bypassing the need for iterative optimization. Our framework naturally quantifies both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, providing well-calibrated predictions. We demonstrate on challenging few-shot regression and classification benchmarks, such as Mini-Imagenet and Omniglot, that BAML not only achieves competitive predictive accuracy but also provides superior uncertainty estimates, a critical advantage for active learning and out-of-distribution detection.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Bayesian Meta-Learning with Amortized Variational Inference for Task-Adaptive Posterior Estimation
"Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art in high-fidelity image synthesis but suffer from high computational costs due to their iterative nature in pixel space. We propose the Latent-Quantized Diffusion Model (LQDM), a novel generative framework that performs the diffusion process in a compressed, discrete latent space learned by a vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE). By operating in this lower-dimensional manifold, LQDM significantly reduces computational complexity. A key innovation is the use of a transformer-based architecture as the denoising network, which is conditioned on the VQ-VAE discrete codes, enabling it to model complex dependencies within the latent space. This hybrid approach synergizes the perceptual richness of VQ-VAE with the powerful score-matching capabilities of diffusion models. Our extensive experiments on ImageNet and FFHQ demonstrate that LQDM achieves FID scores comparable to leading DDPMs while reducing training and inference time by an order of magnitude, setting a new Pareto frontier for generative model efficiency and quality.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Latent Diffusion Models with Vector-Quantized Adversarial Priors for High-Fidelity Image Synthesis
"Solving long-horizon tasks with sparse or delayed rewards remains a central challenge in reinforcement learning. We present Hierarchical Empowerment-driven Skill Acquisition (HESA), a framework that learns a repertoire of intrinsically motivated skills for efficient exploration and planning. HESA operates on two levels: a high-level meta-policy learns to sequence sub-goals, while a low-level skill-policy learns to reach those sub-goals. Crucially, the skill discovery process is not driven by the extrinsic task reward but by an intrinsic motivation signal based on empowerment—the channel capacity between an agent's actions and future states. This encourages the agent to learn a diverse set of controllable and predictable skills. The meta-policy then composes these discovered skills to solve the extrinsic task. We demonstrate that by decoupling skill acquisition from task-specific rewards, HESA can solve complex, sparse-reward robotic manipulation and navigation tasks where standard hierarchical and intrinsic motivation methods fail, exhibiting superior sample efficiency and generalization to unseen goals.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with Information-Theoretic Empowerment for Sparse-Reward Tasks

CACP leverages two modality-specific encoders and a non-linear projection head. The training objective is a symmetric contrastive loss function optimized over batches containing samples from both modalities. By treating samples with similar semantic meaning (determined via a weak, auxiliary signal like co-occurrence in documents) as positive pairs and others as negatives, CACP learns to map text descriptions and corresponding tabular rows to nearby points in the joint embedding space. Experiments on public datasets from finance and healthcare demonstrate that our approach enables effective zero-shot cross-modal retrieval and classification, outperforming methods that rely on generative or reconstruction-based objectives.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Cross-Modal Contrastive Learning for Unpaired Text and Tabular Data Alignment
"Accurate uncertainty quantification is paramount for deploying machine learning models in high-stakes domains. While deep ensembles are a popular heuristic for estimating model uncertainty, they lack formal coverage guarantees. We introduce Conformalized Deep Ensembles (CDE), a hybrid method that combines the strong predictive performance of deep ensembles with the rigorous, distribution-free coverage guarantees of conformal prediction. The CDE method first trains a standard deep ensemble model. Then, during a calibration phase, it uses a holdout dataset to compute non-conformity scores based on the variance of the ensemble's predictions. These scores are used to calibrate a prediction interval that is guaranteed to contain the true outcome with a user-specified probability (e.g., 95%) on future data points, without making any distributional assumptions about the data or model. We demonstrate empirically on several benchmark regression tasks that CDEs produce reliable, well-calibrated prediction intervals that adapt to heteroscedastic noise, achieving robust marginal coverage while maintaining smaller interval sizes compared to other conformal methods.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Distribution-Free Uncertainty Quantification via Conformalized Deep Ensembles

The ST-FNOT treats a sequence of spatial fields as a sequence of tokens. At each time step, an FNO block processes the spatial information by performing convolutions in the Fourier domain, capturing global spatial dependencies efficiently. A subsequent self-attention block operates along the temporal dimension, modeling the long-range evolution of the system's dynamics. This hybrid approach makes our model discretization-invariant in space and robust in time.

The presence of scalar hair is shown to systematically shift the QNM frequencies and damping times relative to their Kerr counterparts. Furthermore, the modified effective potential near the event horizon can create a cavity that traps gravitational waves, leading to a predictable train of 'echoes' following the primary ringdown signal.

Target RNA binding induces a profound conformational rearrangement, allosterically activating the two HEPN nuclease domains by positioning them for catalysis. Importantly, the activated conformation reveals an open, solvent-accessible catalytic pocket distal to the guide-target duplex, providing a structural rationale for its ability to cleave non-target bystander RNAs. Mutational analysis of the inter-domain linkers corroborates this allosteric model and allows for the decoupling of on-target binding from collateral activity. These findings provide a high-resolution blueprint of Cas13d function, informing the rational engineering of CRISPR-based tools with enhanced specificity for therapeutic and diagnostic applications.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Structural Basis for Collateral RNA Cleavage by the CRISPR-Cas13d Effector RfxCas13d
"The precise targeting of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) to specific genomic loci is critical for epigenetic silencing and cell fate determination, yet the mechanisms governing its recruitment remain incompletely defined. We have identified CHROME, a conserved long non-coding RNA, as a key scaffold for PRC2 localization. Using comprehensive chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and chromatin isolation by RNA purification (ChIRP-seq), we demonstrate that CHROME physically associates with the SUZ12 and EZH2 subunits of PRC2. Its selective expression during neurogenesis directs the complex to hundreds of developmental gene promoters, facilitating robust trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3). Genetic ablation of the CHROME locus results in aberrant PRC2 distribution, loss of repressive chromatin marks, and ectopic expression of non-neuronal genes. Our results uncover a fundamental mechanism of lncRNA-mediated epigenetic regulation, where CHROME acts as a molecular beacon to ensure the fidelity of Polycomb-mediated gene silencing during cellular differentiation.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,"A Conserved lncRNA, CHROME, Orchestrates Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 Targeting and H3K27me3 Deposition"
"The DNA damage response (DDR) requires the spatiotemporal concentration of repair factors at sites of DNA lesions. We demonstrate that key DDR proteins 53BP1 and its effector RIF1 undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) to form biomolecular condensates at DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Utilizing in vitro reconstitution assays and super-resolution microscopy in cells, we show these condensates are initiated by the multivalent interactions of phosphorylated 53BP1 oligomers. These phase-separated droplets selectively partition components of the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway while excluding homologous recombination factors. Critically, we find that the unique heterochromatic environment of telomeres enhances 53BP1/RIF1 condensation, thereby promoting pathway choice towards NHEJ for repairing telomeric DSBs. Disruption of 53BP1's condensation capacity via mutagenesis impairs NHEJ efficiency and leads to telomere fusion events. Our findings reveal that LLPS is a primary organizing principle in the DDR, creating localized reaction crucibles that enhance the fidelity of DNA repair pathway selection.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation of 53BP1 and RIF1 Promotes Non-Homologous End Joining at Telomeric DNA Double-Strand Breaks
"Intratumoral heterogeneity is a major obstacle in treating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). To deconstruct this complexity, we performed simultaneous single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) on patient-derived xenograft models of PDAC. Our integrated multi-omic analysis resolved distinct cancer cell subpopulations, including a quasi-mesenchymal state characterized by a unique chromatin accessibility profile at enhancers of key epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) transcription factors like ZEB1 and SNAI2. Pseudotemporal trajectory inference delineated a continuous spectrum of cellular plasticity from classical epithelial to metastatic mesenchymal states, governed by a hierarchical network of transcription factors. We further identified a chemoresistant subpopulation with pre-existing open chromatin at drug efflux pump loci, providing an epigenetic basis for intrinsic resistance. This high-resolution atlas of the PDAC ecosystem uncovers novel markers and regulatory circuits driving tumor progression and chemoresistance, offering new avenues for therapeutic intervention.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Integrated Single-Cell Transcriptomic and Epigenomic Atlas Reveals Cellular Plasticity During Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Progression
"The ribosome is often considered a static macromolecular machine, yet emerging evidence suggests compositional heterogeneity. Using precise quantitative mass spectrometry, we reveal that the stoichiometry of specific ribosomal proteins (RPs) is dynamically modulated in response to oxidative stress and nutrient deprivation. We identified a subset of RPs, including RPL3L and RPS27L, whose incorporation into translating ribosomes is significantly altered under stress conditions. Ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) demonstrated that these 'specialized ribosomes' exhibit altered translational fidelity and preferentially translate specific cohorts of mRNAs, notably those containing upstream open reading frames (uORFs) and encoding stress-response proteins like ATF4. Genetic manipulation of these RP paralogs confirmed their non-redundant roles in tuning the cellular stress response. Our findings challenge the paradigm of a uniform ribosome population, proposing a model where dynamic RP stoichiometry generates specialized translational machinery to rapidly adapt the proteome to environmental cues.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Dynamic Stoichiometry of Ribosomal Proteins Regulates Translational Fidelity and Cellular Stress Responses
"Histone variants play pivotal roles in defining chromatin states, but the functions of many remain unknown. We characterize a previously unannotated histone variant, H3.X, which is specifically deposited at active enhancer elements by a novel chaperone complex, CXC. Using CUT&RUN and native ChIP-seq, we show H3.X enrichment correlates with enhancer activity and transcription factor binding. Biophysical assays reveal that H3.X-containing nucleosomes are intrinsically unstable, exhibiting increased DNA breathing and unwrapping dynamics. Chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) experiments demonstrate that H3.X deposition is associated with local chromatin decompaction and facilitates long-range enhancer-promoter looping. Depletion of H3.X leads to a reduction in chromatin accessibility at enhancers, diminished expression of cognate target genes, and impaired cellular differentiation. Our study establishes H3.X as a key architectural component of active enhancers, mechanically linking histone variant deposition to the regulation of cis-regulatory element function and gene expression.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,The Histone Variant H3.X Mediates Chromatin Decompaction and Transcriptional Activation at Enhancer Elements
"Ubiquitin chains with distinct linkages constitute a complex code that regulates diverse cellular processes, but the function of atypical linkages remains largely cryptic. Here, we investigate the signaling role of lysine 6 (K6)-linked polyubiquitin chains in mitophagy. We identified the E3 ligase RNF144 as the primary catalyst for K6-chain synthesis on the mitochondrial outer membrane protein VDAC2 following mitochondrial depolarization. Using linkage-specific antibodies and quantitative mass spectrometry, we show that these K6 chains serve as a specific docking signal for the autophagy receptor NDP52, but not Optineurin or p62. Structural studies of the NDP52-ubiquitin interface reveal a unique binding pocket that confers high specificity for the K6 linkage topology. Conversely, the deubiquitinase USP30 antagonizes this interaction by selectively cleaving K6 chains. Our work deciphers a precise ubiquitin-based signaling axis where a specific linkage type dictates receptor engagement, thereby ensuring the fidelity of selective organelle clearance.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Deciphering a K6-Linked Ubiquitin Code that Licenses Mitophagic Receptors for Selective Autophagy

"Pre-mRNA splicing is tightly coupled to transcription, but the molecular mechanisms that ensure its efficiency and fidelity remain debated. By employing native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-Seq) and single-molecule imaging, we investigated the kinetics of spliceosome assembly on nascent transcripts in real time. Our data reveal that the phosphorylation status of the RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) C-terminal domain (CTD) directly modulates splicing rates. Specifically, phosphorylation of Serine 2 (Ser2-P) by CDK9 serves as a recruitment platform for the U2AF splicing factor complex, accelerating splice site recognition and intron commitment. Conversely, inhibiting CTD phosphorylation or inducing transcriptional pausing leads to a significant delay in co-transcriptional splicing, increasing the frequency of alternative splicing events. Our findings support a kinetic coupling model where the transcriptional elongation rate, governed by the RNAPII CTD code, synchronizes with splicing machinery recruitment to ensure precise and efficient intron excision from the nascent pre-mRNA.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Co-transcriptional Splicing Kinetics are Modulated by RNA Polymerase II Phosphorylation State
"Ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) is a crucial surveillance pathway that degrades aberrant nascent polypeptides arising from stalled translation. The mechanism by which the RQC complex extracts stalled nascent chains from the ribosomal exit tunnel is poorly understood. Using time-resolved cryo-electron microscopy, we have captured multiple intermediate states of the yeast RQC complex engaged with stalled 80S ribosomes. Our structures show that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Ltn1 and the ATPase Vms1 assemble into a helical filament that encircles the nascent chain. ATP hydrolysis by Vms1 induces a concerted conformational change, driving a rotational, screw-like motion of the filament. This torsional force is transmitted to the nascent polypeptide, progressively pulling it from the exit tunnel. Molecular dynamics simulations and mutagenesis data support this 'torsional extraction' model. This work uncovers a novel, rotation-based mechanical principle for polypeptide translocation, providing fundamental insights into cellular protein quality control machinery.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,The Ribosome-Associated Quality Control Complex Employs a Helical Torsion Mechanism for Stalled Nascent Chain Extraction

Multispecies coalescent models and phylogenetic network analyses robustly identify at least five distinct, deeply divergent lineages, warranting species-level recognition despite their phenotypic uniformity. Demographic modeling reveals a history of climatic vicariance followed by secondary contact and asymmetric introgression. Analyses of genomic islands of divergence using FST and dXY scans pinpoint loci associated with thermal tolerance and call acoustics that may contribute to reproductive isolation.

"The role of non-Mendelian inheritance in adaptation remains a central question in evolutionary biology. We explored the contribution of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance to rapid adaptation by exposing isogenic Arabidopsis thaliana lineages to fluctuating salinity stress for ten generations. Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and RNA-seq, we identified hundreds of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that were stably inherited for at least three generations post-stress. These heritable epimutations were significantly enriched in the promoter regions of stress-responsive genes and were strongly correlated with altered transcriptional profiles and enhanced salt tolerance phenotypes. Critically, reversion to ancestral methylation states occurred at a higher rate than de novo epimutation, suggesting a plastic yet heritable mechanism. Our results provide direct evidence that DNA methylation can act as a parallel inheritance system, providing a reservoir of selectable phenotypic variation that accelerates adaptation to novel environmental challenges on contemporary timescales.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Transgenerational Epigenetic Inheritance Facilitates Rapid Adaptation to Salinity Stress in Arabidopsis thaliana
"The theory of antagonistic pleiotropy posits that alleles with beneficial effects on early-life fitness are favored by selection despite having deleterious late-life consequences, thus driving the evolution of senescence. We tested this hypothesis through a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for fecundity and lifespan in a large panel of Drosophila melanogaster. We identified several loci exhibiting strong signatures of antagonistic pleiotropy, where alleles positively correlated with early-life reproductive output were significantly associated with accelerated age-related mortality. A polygenic risk score analysis confirmed that a genetic predisposition for high early fecundity predicts a shorter lifespan. Functional annotation of candidate genes implicates pathways related to TOR signaling and mitochondrial metabolism.

By applying formal tests for admixture, including Patterson's D-statistic and f4-ratio estimation, we characterized a gradient of introgression around the Tibetan Plateau. While most of the genome shows evidence of extensive historical gene flow, we identified multiple discrete genomic regions with sharply reduced introgression between divergent northern forms. These 'genomic barriers' are significantly enriched for genes related to plumage patterning (e.g., Agouti-signaling protein) and neural development associated with song learning, suggesting a primary role for divergent selection on mating signals in maintaining reproductive isolation.

Deep sequencing of bacterial CRISPR loci and phage genomes revealed rapid, reciprocal evolutionary dynamics consistent with the Red Queen hypothesis. Bacteria rapidly acquired new phage-targeting spacers, leading to transient selective sweeps. In response, phages evolved mutations in protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs) or, more frequently, acquired and diversified anti-CRISPR (Acr) genes that directly inhibit Cas9 function. Phylogenetic analysis of Acr variants showed signatures of strong positive selection.

We quantified patterns of phenotypic integration in the cranium of 428 species of African cichlid fishes using high-dimensional geometric morphometrics and phylogenetic comparative methods. By comparing evolutionary covariance matrices (G-matrices), we identified a conserved modular architecture across the radiation, partitioning the skull into oral jaw, neurocranial, and suspensorial units. While strong integration exists within modules, the weaker covariation between them facilitates semi-independent evolution. Lineage-specific shifts in evolutionary rates are disproportionately concentrated in the oral jaw module, directly corresponding with trophic specialization. Our results suggest that this modular architecture acted as a key innovation, channeling morphological diversification by allowing rapid adaptation in feeding mechanics without compromising the functional integrity of other cranial systems, thereby facilitating one of the most explosive adaptive radiations known.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Macroevolutionary Modularity and Phenotypic Integration Constrain and Facilitate the Cichlid Cranial Radiation

Using a robust, time-calibrated phylogeny of 150 species and a novel Bayesian stochastic character mapping approach, we reconstructed the evolutionary history of conotoxin gene superfamilies. Our analysis reveals at least six independent origins of neurotoxins targeting the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Despite originating from different ancestral gene families via repeated gene duplication and neofunctionalization events, these toxins evolved functionally equivalent pharmacophores through distinct structural pathways. Patterns of dN/dS > 1 along convergent branches indicate strong positive selection driving this functional homoplasy.

We identified over 2,000 high-confidence HGT events, revealing that the acquisition of prokaryotic genes is a widespread and ongoing process, particularly in microbial eukaryotes and certain invertebrate metazoans like bdelloid rotifers and tardigrades. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis shows that transferred genes are disproportionately involved in novel metabolic pathways, carbohydrate utilization, and stress tolerance (e.g., anhydrobiosis).

We investigated the genomic basis of parallel adaptation in multiple freshwater populations of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) derived from a common marine ancestor. Population genomic analysis using whole-genome sequencing revealed that adaptation to freshwater environments is predominantly fueled by standing genetic variation present in the ancestral marine population. We observed recurrent soft selective sweeps at numerous loci, where the same ancestral haplotypes rose to high frequency in independent freshwater populations. FST outlier analyses identified key genes, including Ectodysplasin (Eda) for armor plate reduction and Pitx1 for pelvic reduction, as primary targets of this parallel selection.

TopoGCL employs persistent homology to compute topological invariants, such as Betti numbers and persistence diagrams, from graph filtrations. These multi-scale topological signatures serve as a supervisory signal within a contrastive objective, forcing the model to learn embeddings that are invariant to homologically trivial structural changes while remaining sensitive to significant topological shifts.

"Causal Set Theory posits that spacetime is fundamentally discrete, with the continuum manifold emerging as a macroscopic approximation. This work investigates the quantum dynamics of causal sets using a path integral formulation based on the Benincasa-Dowker action. We perform numerical simulations of the sequential growth dynamics governed by a covariant stochastic process (a 'sprinkle'), from which macroscopic spacetimes are generated. Our analysis demonstrates that a Lorentzian signature and macroscopic dimensionality spontaneously emerge without being presupposed. Furthermore, we explore the fluctuations in the spacetime volume, relating them to the cosmological constant. The model naturally produces a value for Λ that fluctuates around zero, with a magnitude suppressed by the square root of the number of elements in the causal set. This provides a novel, purely quantum-gravitational mechanism for addressing the enormous discrepancy between the theoretically predicted and observationally measured value of the cosmological constant, circumventing the fine-tuning problem.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Kuantum,Generated,Quantum Dynamics on Causal Sets: Emergence of Lorentzian Signature and the Cosmological Constant Problem

By implementing optimized, dynamically corrected gate sequences—specifically, the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) and Knill dynamical decoupling protocols—we successfully suppress decoherence from the surrounding spin bath, extending the coherence time (T₂) by over two orders of magnitude. We demonstrate arbitrary quantum state preparation and single-shot readout with fidelities exceeding 99.5% for the central electronic spin. Furthermore, we achieve deterministic entanglement between the NV electron and three distinct nuclear spins via hyperfine-mediated quantum logic gates.

By meticulously characterizing the energy fluctuations and applying the Jarzynski equality, we verify quantum fluctuation theorems far from thermal equilibrium. Our results demonstrate that the work extracted is directly proportional to the Shannon information gained from the measurement, saturating Landauer's principle in the quasi-static limit. We critically analyze the role of quantum coherence during the barrier insertion phase and the thermodynamic cost associated with measurement back-action and information erasure.

This configuration allows for the amplification of the faint signal from axion-to-photon conversion while simultaneously squeezing the quantum vacuum noise of the electromagnetic field below the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL) of 1/2 photon. Our theoretical model, incorporating back-action evasion and quantum non-demolition measurement principles, predicts an axion search scan rate enhancement proportional to the degree of squeezing. We project a sensitivity to the axion-photon coupling constant gₐᵧᵧ that surpasses existing limits by over an order of magnitude in the 5-10 GHz mass range.

We theoretically investigate and experimentally demonstrate the physics of higher-order EPs in a coupled photonic waveguide array with precisely engineered gain and loss profiles. Our analysis reveals that the system undergoes a topological phase transition as a parameter is tuned across the EP, characterized by a change in a winding number defined for the complex energy spectrum. Critically, we exploit the divergent response of the system's eigenfrequencies to external perturbations near the EP. We demonstrate an enhanced sensitivity to local refractive index changes, with the frequency splitting scaling as ε¹/ᴺ for an Nth-order EP, where ε is the perturbation strength.

In our scheme, one atomic species represents the fermionic matter fields (staggered fermions), while the other mediates the interaction, encoding the gauge fields on the links of the lattice via a set of precisely controlled laser-assisted tunneling processes. We detail the mapping of the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian to the atomic system and show how Gauss's law is enforced through energy penalties.

"The fragmented montane habitats of the Andes harbor exceptional biodiversity, yet the evolutionary processes generating this diversity remain incompletely understood. We employed a phylogenomic approach, integrating ultraconserved element (UCE) sequencing and coalescent-based species delimitation methods, to investigate a species complex of high-elevation furnariids. Our analyses, based on over 1,500 loci from 280 individuals, reject the current taxonomy and reveal at least seven distinct, deeply divergent lineages corresponding to isolated 'sky-island' populations. Widespread phylogenetic discordance, attributable to incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), necessitated multispecies coalescent modeling, which strongly supported the delimitation of these cryptic taxa. Molecular dating calibrated with fossil evidence indicates that divergence events coincided with glacial-interglacial cycles of the late Pleistocene, suggesting that climatic oscillations drove repeated vicariance and allopatric speciation. This pronounced taxonomic inflation underscores the cryptic nature of avian diversity in topographically complex regions and highlights the imperative of integrating genomic data for robust conservation assessment.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Phylogenomics of Andean Sky-Island Avians Reveals Rampant Cryptic Speciation Driven by Pleistocene Climatic Oscillations

Here, we characterize a deeply divergent haplotype block encompassing the STAT2 gene, a key component of the type-I interferon pathway, introgressed from a Neanderthal-related lineage. Using local ancestry inference across diverse human populations, we demonstrate this haplotype reached high frequencies in specific Eurasian groups post-Out-of-Africa. Functional assays using engineered cell lines reveal that the introgressed STAT2 allele confers a hyper-responsive phenotype to viral dsRNA analogues, leading to potentiated antiviral gene expression but also increased pro-inflammatory signaling. We propose a model wherein this variant provided a selective advantage against enzootic viral pathogens encountered during human expansion, exemplifying how archaic admixture provided a reservoir of pre-adapted alleles that facilitated rapid environmental adaptation.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Adaptive Introgression of an Archaic STAT2 Haplotype Modulated Viral Response in Early Holocene Human Populations

We investigated the evolutionary trajectory of the Engrailed (En) gene, a transcription factor with conserved roles in segmentation and neurogenesis. By performing CRISPR-Cas9-mediated allelic replacement with orthologs from divergent Drosophilid species, we quantified the pleiotropic consequences on adult morphology and fitness. We observed profound antagonistic pleiotropy, where alleles enhancing wing vein patterning invariably disrupted bristle formation and reduced fecundity. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that En interacts within a highly interconnected and buffered gene regulatory network (GRN), which canalizes its developmental output. Our results suggest that the GRN's topology itself evolves to mitigate deleterious pleiotropy, thereby constraining the phenotypic space accessible to En mutations. This network-level buffering provides a mechanistic basis for developmental canalization and explains the evolutionary stasis of key body plan regulators.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Pleiotropic Constraint and the Canalization of a Developmental Gene Regulatory Network in Drosophila
"Eco-evolutionary dynamics posit that ecological and evolutionary processes can occur on contemporaneous timescales, creating feedback loops. We tested this hypothesis using a chemostat system with the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus preying on the alga Chlorella vulgaris. We tracked population densities and allele frequencies at loci associated with nutrient uptake and allocation for over 500 generations. Our results demonstrate that predator-induced nutrient limitation imposed strong selection on algal populations, favoring genotypes with lower phosphorus requirements (higher C:P ratios). This rapid evolution in algal stoichiometry, in turn, altered the carrying capacity and population dynamics of the rotifer predator, modifying the period and amplitude of the predator-prey cycles. Integrating these empirical results into a coupled eco-evolutionary model confirms that the evolutionary trajectory of the prey's elemental composition is a primary driver of ecosystem stability, highlighting the necessity of incorporating microevolutionary change into predictive ecological models.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Eco-Evolutionary Feedbacks in a Planktonic System: Rapid Evolution of Stoichiometric Traits Drives Predator-Prey Cycle Dynamics

Using whole-genome resequencing data, we identified over 300 small-effect loci significantly associated with cone serotiny, confirming a highly polygenic architecture. These loci were enriched in gene ontology categories related to lignin biosynthesis, abscisic acid signaling, and heat-shock response. A polygenic risk score derived from these loci strongly predicted the serotiny phenotype in independent validation populations. Furthermore, patterns of allele frequency differentiation at these loci suggest a history of spatially varying selection corresponding to local fire frequencies. Our findings illustrate how complex, ecologically crucial traits can evolve via subtle, coordinated frequency shifts across numerous genes in response to heterogeneous environmental pressures.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,The Polygenic Architecture of Serotiny: A Genome-Wide Association Study in a Fire-Adapted Conifer Reveals a History of Local Adaptation
"Kin selection theory, encapsulated by Hamilton's rule (rB > C), is the foundational explanation for the evolution of altruism. However, precisely quantifying the rule's components—relatedness (r), benefit (B), and cost (C)—in natural systems remains a formidable challenge. We conducted a socio-genomic study in the paper wasp Polistes dominula, combining high-resolution behavioral observations with genomic relatedness estimates derived from thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). By tracking the lifetime reproductive success of over 500 individuals, we calculated the fitness costs to subordinate helpers (C) and the fitness benefits to the dominant queen (B). Our data demonstrate a clear positive correlation between a helper's inclusive fitness and their decision to forage for the colony. Crucially, the threshold for altruistic helping behavior closely matched the predictions of Hamilton's rule when accounting for the full distribution of relatedness within colonies. This provides robust empirical validation for kin selection theory in a complex social environment.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Genomic Estimation of Inclusive Fitness Components Validates Hamilton's Rule in a Eusocial Wasp
"Host-parasite coevolution is often characterized by a reciprocal 'arms race' driven by negative frequency-dependent selection.

We focused on the interaction between a host Nucleotide-Binding Leucine-Rich Repeat (NLR) protein, RPP13, and its corresponding pathogen effector protein, ATR13. Population genomic analysis across diverse geographic ranges revealed multiple, lineage-specific hard selective sweeps in both genes. The regions of highest polymorphism and divergence were localized to the leucine-rich repeat domain of RPP13 and the C-terminal domain of ATR13, consistent with direct physical interaction. Ancestral sequence reconstruction and functional assays demonstrate that these recurrent sweeps correspond to novel recognition specificities in the host and corresponding evasion mutations in the pathogen. This tightly coupled pattern of reciprocal, domain-specific positive selection provides compelling molecular evidence for Red Queen dynamics at the level of interacting proteins.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Molecular Evidence for a Red Queen Arms Race: Recurrent Selective Sweeps in a Plant NLR Gene and a Fungal Effector
"Small, isolated populations are vulnerable to the accumulation of deleterious mutations due to the overwhelming power of genetic drift relative to selection. We integrated long-term demographic data with whole-genome sequences from the critically endangered Socorro Dove (Zenaida graysoni) to quantify this process. Population viability analysis (PVA) models, parameterized with 30 years of field data, confirmed a history of extreme bottlenecks and demographic stochasticity. We then estimated the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) for new nonsynonymous mutations using a polymorphism-and-divergence-based approach. Our results show a significant enrichment of fixed, slightly-to-moderately deleterious mutations in the Socorro Dove genome compared to its widespread sister taxon. The rate of accumulation of this mutational load, predicted by our genomic DFE, aligns closely with the effective population size (Ne) trajectories inferred from the PVA.

While most single mutations were neutral or deleterious, we identified a sparse network of beneficial mutations. The double-mutant landscape revealed pervasive and complex epistasis. Notably, sign epistasis, where a mutation is beneficial on one genetic background but deleterious on another, was common, occurring in over 20% of mutant pairs. This rugged landscape structure creates numerous local fitness peaks and deep valleys, severely constraining evolutionary pathways to higher antibiotic resistance. Only a limited subset of mutational trajectories are accessible to gradual evolution, highlighting how epistatic interactions among mutations dictate the predictability and repeatability of adaptation.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Mapping the Topography of a Fitness Landscape Reveals Pervasive Sign Epistasis and Constrains Evolutionary Trajectories

Using comparative genomics across dozens of species with divergent jaw morphologies, we identified thousands of recent TE insertions, primarily from the SINE and LINE families, that are polymorphic within the radiation. A significant fraction of these insertions occur in cis-regulatory regions of genes involved in craniofacial development (e.g., bmp4, eda). Chromatin accessibility assays (ATAC-seq) and luciferase reporter assays confirm that a specific SINE family, AfraSINE, contains potent enhancer elements that can be co-opted to drive novel gene expression patterns in the developing jaw. The distribution of these TE-derived enhancers is strongly correlated with divergent feeding ecologies, suggesting that TE mobilization provided a rich substrate of regulatory variation that was repeatedly exapted during the cichlid radiation.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Transposable Element Exaptation as a Major Driver of Adaptive Radiation in African Cichlids

By employing a time-convolutionless master equation approach, we analytically and numerically solve for the system's evolution, tracking entanglement via the Peres-Horodecki criterion and multipartite negativity. Our results reveal a pronounced non-monotonic decay of entanglement, characterized by significant revival epochs whose duration and amplitude are contingent on the reservoir's memory kernel and the qubit-field coupling strength. This revival phenomenon is attributed to the backflow of quantum information from the environment to the system, a hallmark of non-Markovianity. We further demonstrate that applying a periodic external driving field can coherently control these revivals, effectively creating a controllable quantum memory.

Crucially, we show that when this heterostructure is sculpted into a finite geometry, one-dimensional chiral hinge modes emerge at the intersection of surfaces with opposite magnetic exchange-field signs. These modes are protected by a generalized crystalline symmetry and are robust against non-magnetic disorder.

We report a profound violation of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) across all relevant length scales, quantifying the deviation via an effective temperature that is frequency- and wavevector-dependent. This violation is directly linked to the persistent energy flux at the microscopic level, which sustains the system's emergent turbulent-like collective motion and giant number fluctuations.

By numerically solving the Teukolsky and Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli equations for perturbations on a background spacetime deviating from the standard Kerr metric, we generate precision GW waveforms. Our analysis reveals that the presence of scalar hair introduces distinct modifications to the quasi-normal mode frequencies and induces a characteristic dephasing in the inspiral waveform compared to its general relativistic counterpart. This dephasing accumulates over the thousands of orbits typical for an EMRI, rendering it a detectable signature for next-generation space-based GW observatories like LISA.

We propose a novel objective, Cross-Modal Information Bottleneck (CM-IB), that regularizes contrastive learning by explicitly minimizing the mutual information between the learned representations and the input, while maximizing it between representations of different modalities. This forces the model to learn a minimal, sufficient representation that captures only the essential shared semantic information. We implement CM-IB by introducing a variational approximation to the mutual information terms, which can be seamlessly integrated into a dual-encoder architecture. Our experiments on large-scale image-text datasets, including MS-COCO and Conceptual Captions, demonstrate that CM-IB yields more robust and semantically meaningful embeddings.

"Solving complex, long-horizon tasks with sparse rewards is a central challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). We present a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework, Successor Feature Skill Discovery (SFSD), that enables an agent to autonomously discover and compose temporally extended skills. Unlike traditional options-based HRL, SFSD does not require predefined subgoals. Instead, a lower-level policy discovers a diverse set of skills by maximizing a variational intrinsic reward based on the empowerment over successor features—abstractions of the expected future state occupancies. A high-level meta-policy then learns to sequence these discovered skills to solve the extrinsic task. This approach creates a clean separation between skill discovery and task-specific learning, promoting transferability.

"We propose a unified framework for deep neural network compression, Hessian-Aware Pruning and Quantization (HAPQ), that co-optimizes structured pruning and mixed-precision quantization to achieve maximal model compression with minimal accuracy degradation. Conventional methods often treat pruning and quantization as sequential, sub-optimal steps. In contrast, HAPQ leverages second-order information from the loss function's Hessian to jointly determine the importance of network structures (filters or channels) and the optimal bit-width for quantizing weight tensors. Our method formulates a global optimization problem with a constrained budget for model size or FLOPs, which is solved iteratively. The Hessian information provides a principled way to estimate the impact of removing a structure or reducing precision, allowing the algorithm to make more informed decisions. We demonstrate on ImageNet and COCO benchmarks that HAPQ surpasses existing state-of-the-art compression techniques, achieving superior Pareto frontiers for the accuracy-compression trade-off across a range of convolutional architectures.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Hessian-Aware Structured Pruning and Non-Uniform Quantization for Optimal Network Compression
"Bridging the gap between subsymbolic pattern recognition and symbolic reasoning is a key objective for achieving more robust and generalizable AI. We introduce Differentiable Logic Tensor Networks (DLTNs), a neuro-symbolic framework that enables end-to-end learning of perceptual systems and logical reasoners. DLTNs represent symbolic knowledge, expressed in first-order logic, within a continuous tensorized space. Logical predicates and functions are parameterized by neural networks, and logical connectives are implemented as differentiable tensor operations. We develop a novel semantic unification algorithm that performs fuzzy unification over learned entity embeddings, allowing the system to reason with facts grounded in perceptual data. The entire model is trained end-to-end by minimizing a loss function that reflects logical inconsistency in the knowledge base. We demonstrate the efficacy of DLTNs on complex visual question answering and knowledge base completion tasks, where our model significantly outperforms purely neural or symbolic baselines by effectively combining high-level reasoning with low-level perception.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,End-to-End Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning via Differentiable First-Order Logic Programming
"This paper presents a scalable Bayesian nonparametric framework for topic modeling that incorporates document-specific covariates to inform the thematic structure. We extend the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) by parameterizing the top-level stick-breaking process weights as a logistic-normal function of observed covariates, allowing topic prevalence to vary systematically across a corpus. Direct posterior inference is intractable; thus, we develop a Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI) algorithm that optimizes the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) using natural gradients. This approach circumvents the restrictive mean-field assumptions of traditional variational methods by employing a structured approximation for the global topic atoms. We derive theoretical guarantees on the posterior contraction rates for the topic distributions and the covariate regression coefficients. Experiments on large-scale text corpora demonstrate our model's enhanced predictive performance, improved topic interpretability, and significant computational speedup over comparable MCMC-based methods, making it suitable for modern data-intensive applications.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,Scalable Variational Inference for Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Models with Covariate-Dependent Dynamics

Our method, termed Spatio-Correlated Manifold FPCA (SCM-FPCA), models individual trajectories as geodesics fluctuating around a global Fréchet mean function. The principal modes of variation are defined as orthogonal tangent vector fields on the manifold, derived from a spectral decomposition of a spatially-weighted covariance operator. Estimation is performed via an iterative tangent space projection algorithm that alternates between estimating the Fréchet mean and the eigenfunctions. We establish the consistency of the estimated functional principal components and scores under suitable regularity and mixing conditions on the spatial process. The methodology is validated through simulations on spherical and Symmetric Positive-Definite matrix-valued functions and is applied to analyze spatio-temporal brain connectivity patterns from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,Manifold-Valued Functional Principal Component Analysis for Spatially Correlated Trajectory Data

However, a significant gap remains in performing rigorous statistical inference on topological features. This paper introduces a robust, computationally feasible framework for constructing confidence regions for persistence diagrams. We propose a subsampling-based method, the Bottleneck Bootstrap, which leverages the intrinsic metric structure of the space of persistence diagrams. Unlike naive bootstrap approaches, our method is provably consistent for constructing confidence sets for the underlying limiting diagram under weak assumptions on the data-generating process. We rigorously establish the asymptotic validity and convergence rates for the estimated confidence regions. The practical utility is demonstrated by applying our inferential framework to differentiate between simulated point cloud data from distinct distributions and to analyze topological features in a dataset of cosmic microwave background radiation maps, enabling quantification of uncertainty in detected cosmic voids.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,A Statistical Framework for Inference on Persistent Homology using the Bottleneck Bootstrap
"We propose a novel estimation procedure for the Fine-Gray subdistribution hazards model with time-varying coefficients to analyze competing risks data in high dimensions. The temporal dynamics of covariate effects are modeled nonparametrically using B-spline basis expansions. To ensure interpretability and parsimony, we introduce a fused-group LASSO penalty on the spline coefficients. This structured penalty simultaneously performs variable selection by shrinking entire coefficient functions to zero and encourages local constancy by penalizing differences between adjacent spline coefficients. We develop an efficient block coordinate descent algorithm for computation of the entire regularization path. Theoretically, we establish the non-asymptotic oracle inequalities for the proposed estimator, demonstrating its consistency and optimal convergence rates. The method's empirical performance is evaluated through simulation studies, showing its superiority in both prediction and variable selection compared to standard time-invariant models and unpenalized time-varying approaches.

Existing methods often rely on restrictive parametric assumptions, such as linearity or Gaussianity. We develop a flexible Bayesian semiparametric framework for learning DAGs from datasets containing mixed variables (continuous, count, and categorical). Our approach is based on a latent variable model, using Gaussian copulas to flexibly model the conditional dependencies without specifying marginal distributions. This allows for the detection of complex, non-linear relationships. We propose a novel structure MCMC algorithm that combines local proposals in the graph space with an efficient Gibbs sampler for the latent variables and model parameters. We prove posterior consistency for both the graph structure and the model parameters under mild regularity conditions.

"This paper introduces a Factor-Adjusted Regularized Vector Autoregression (FAR-VAR) model for forecasting and structural analysis of high-dimensional, non-stationary time series. The methodology operates in two stages. First, it decomposes the series into a common component driven by a few pervasive latent factors and an idiosyncratic component. We employ dynamic principal component analysis to consistently estimate the factor structure even in the presence of I(1) non-stationarity and structural breaks. Second, a high-dimensional VAR model is fitted to the quasi-stationary idiosyncratic components using a structured penalty, such as an adaptive elastic net, to enforce sparsity on the transition matrix. This decomposition effectively mitigates issues of spurious regression and parameter proliferation that plague standard VARs in high dimensions. We derive non-asymptotic error bounds for the estimated factor loadings, transition matrices, and impulse response functions. The model demonstrates superior forecasting accuracy over competing methods in simulations and an application to large-scale macroeconomic data, providing coherent economic interpretations.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,Factor-Adjusted Vector Autoregression for High-Dimensional Time Series with Non-Stationary Components
"The Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) is frequently violated in settings where units are interconnected, leading to biased causal effect estimates. We propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate direct and indirect (spillover) causal effects in the presence of network interference. Our approach generalizes the potential outcomes framework by defining a unit’s exposure as a function of its own treatment and a summary of its neighborhood's treatment assignments. We parameterize the dose-response functions flexibly using Gaussian processes and embed them within a hierarchical structure that allows for borrowing of information across network clusters. This clustering is determined endogenously via a Dirichlet process mixture model on node embeddings. Posterior computation proceeds via a custom MCMC algorithm. We prove posterior consistency for the average direct and indirect effects under certain graph regularity conditions.

"We present a computationally scalable framework for modeling large-scale, non-stationary spatio-temporal data. The methodology leverages a multi-resolution analysis by projecting the underlying spatial process at each time point onto a sparse wavelet basis. This projection induces a sparse representation of the spatial covariance structure, effectively reducing the dimensionality of the problem from the number of spatial locations to the number of significant wavelet coefficients. The temporal evolution of these coefficients is then captured by a multivariate dynamic linear model (DLM), which can accommodate non-stationary temporal dynamics and allows for efficient recursive computation via the Kalman filter. This approach circumvents the prohibitive cubic complexity of traditional full-rank Gaussian Process models. We establish theoretical bounds on the approximation error from the basis projection and demonstrate the model’s superior predictive accuracy and computational efficiency on a large dataset of satellite-derived sea surface temperature measurements, compared to spatio-temporal Kriging and latent process models.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,Dynamic Multi-Resolution Spatio-Temporal Models via Gaussian Process Projections on Wavelet Bases
"This paper introduces a new class of robust regression estimators by minimizing the Wasserstein divergence between the empirical distribution of residuals and a specified symmetric, centered reference distribution. This Minimum Wasserstein Divergence Estimator (MWDE) offers a geometrically intuitive alternative to classical M-estimators. We establish the theoretical properties of the MWDE, including existence, strong consistency, and asymptotic normality under weak regularity conditions. Crucially, we derive its influence function and demonstrate that it is bounded and redescending, confirming the estimator's high robustness against leverage points and vertical outliers. A computationally efficient algorithm is developed by leveraging the dual formulation of the entropic-regularized optimal transport problem. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations show that the MWDE achieves superior performance over traditional robust methods like Least Trimmed Squares and Huber's estimator, particularly under high contamination, while retaining high efficiency at the Gaussian model. The method's utility is illustrated through an analysis of a real-world dataset from econometrics.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,Robust Regression and Inference via Minimum Wasserstein Divergence Estimation
"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) often fail to capture the underlying topological structure of data manifolds, leading to mode collapse and synthesis of non-homologous artifacts. We introduce a novel topological regularization framework, TopoGAN, that enforces manifold-preservation by penalizing topological discrepancies between the real and generated data distributions. Our approach leverages persistent homology, a key tool from topological data analysis, to characterize the data's multi-scale topological features (e.g., connected components, loops). The regularizer is formulated as a differentiable loss term based on the sliced Wasserstein distance between persistence diagrams computed from mini-batches of real and generated samples. This term is integrated into a Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) architecture, guiding the generator to learn the correct Betti numbers of the target manifold. We demonstrate empirically on synthetic datasets (e.g., tori, Swiss rolls) and complex image benchmarks that our method significantly mitigates mode collapse, preserves homotopy types, and generates samples of higher topological fidelity compared to state-of-the-art baselines.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Topological Regularization of Latent Spaces in Generative Adversarial Networks for Manifold-Preserving Data Synthesis
"Standard reinforcement learning algorithms exhibit brittleness in non-stationary environments, as they often exploit spurious correlations that fail to generalize when environmental dynamics or reward functions shift. To address this, we propose Causal-Interventional Reinforcement Learning (CIRL), a framework that endows agents with the ability to reason about causal mechanisms. CIRL first learns a structural causal model (SCM) of the environment from observational data and limited interventional experiments. Subsequently, the policy is optimized not only on observed state-action trajectories but also on counterfactual outcomes estimated via the do-calculus on the learned SCM. This interventional training objective forces the agent to disentangle causal factors from confounding variables, leading to more robust policy learning. We instantiate CIRL by coupling a graph-based causal discovery module with a deep Q-network. Empirical evaluations across a suite of benchmarks with systematic compositional changes show that CIRL achieves superior zero-shot transfer performance, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art model-based and model-free RL algorithms that rely on purely observational learning.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Causal-Interventional Reinforcement Learning for Robust Policy Generalization in Non-Stationary Environments
"Modeling continuous-time dynamics on graphs with time-varying topologies is a formidable challenge for discrete-time Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We introduce Neural Graph Ordinary Differential Equations (NGDEs), a novel deep learning framework that learns the continuous-time evolution of node representations on dynamic graphs. NGDEs parameterize the derivative of the node hidden states using a GNN, thereby defining a vector field that governs the system's dynamics. The evolution is computed by integrating this vector field using a numerical ODE solver, which naturally handles irregularly sampled data. To accommodate evolving graph structures, we introduce a time-varying graph Laplacian formulated within a Riemannian geometry framework, treating the system as evolving on a dynamic manifold. This continuous-depth approach provides a principled way to model complex spatio-temporal processes. We demonstrate that NGDEs achieve state-of-the-art performance on traffic forecasting with dynamic road networks and particle physics simulation tasks, excelling at both interpolation and long-term extrapolation compared to recurrent GNNs and other continuous-time models.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Neural Graph Ordinary Differential Equations for Spatio-Temporal Dynamics on Evolving Manifolds

Our system integrates client-level (ε, δ)-differential privacy via noise injection and gradient clipping with a novel Byzantine-resilient secure aggregation protocol. To prevent malicious contributions, we introduce a verifiable decentralized trust mechanism. Each client’s update, encrypted using a threshold homomorphic encryption scheme, is accompanied by a zero-knowledge proof of correctness, attesting to the update's consistency with the client's local data statistics. A distributed ledger maintains trust scores for all participants, allowing the server to perform a weighted aggregation that down-weights or excludes contributions from clients with historically low trust scores, without ever decrypting individual updates. Theoretical analysis and empirical results on non-IID benchmarks demonstrate that AegisFL maintains high model utility while providing provable resilience against a significant fraction of Byzantine attackers.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Byzantine-Resilient and Differentially Private Federated Learning via Secure Aggregation with Verifiable Decentralized Trust
"Aligning representations from disparate modalities like vision and language is fundamental to multimodal AI, yet existing contrastive learning methods often struggle with semantic ambiguity and require vast paired datasets. We propose Cross-Modal Prototypical Contrastive Learning (X-PCL), a self-supervised framework that learns a shared semantic embedding space by aligning clusters of prototypes instead of individual instances. X-PCL first performs intra-modal clustering to discover semantic prototypes within each modality's embedding space. Subsequently, a prototype-level contrastive loss pulls together corresponding cross-modal prototypes while pushing apart non-matching ones. This cluster-based objective encourages the model to learn a more semantically structured and robust joint manifold, abstracting away instance-level noise. Framed through an information bottleneck perspective, the prototypes act as a compressed representation of semantic concepts. X-PCL achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot text-to-image retrieval on MS-COCO and Flickr30k, demonstrating superior fine-grained alignment and robustness to noisy data pairings compared to instance-based contrastive methods.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Cross-Modal Prototypical Contrastive Learning for Zero-Shot Multimodal Alignment
"Gradient-based meta-learning algorithms like MAML treat the parameter space as Euclidean, ignoring the intrinsic geometry of the task-specific loss landscapes. This can lead to inefficient adaptation and suboptimal generalization. We propose a new meta-learning framework that reframes the optimization problem on a Riemannian manifold of loss functions. Our approach, Riemannian Meta-Learning (RML), learns a parameter initialization that minimizes the expected geodesic distance to the task-specific optima. The meta-update is performed via a hyper-gradient step governed by the natural gradient, which leverages the Fisher Information Matrix as the Riemannian metric tensor. This pre-conditions the meta-update with respect to the curvature of the loss manifold, enabling more direct and efficient paths toward adaptation. We derive a computationally tractable approximation of the Fisher matrix that allows RML to scale to deep neural networks. On challenging few-shot classification and regression benchmarks, RML demonstrates significantly faster adaptation and converges to solutions with superior generalization capabilities compared to prominent Euclidean-based meta-learning algorithms.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Hyper-Gradient Dynamics on the Loss Manifold: A Riemannian Approach to Meta-Learning
"The quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism in Transformers poses a significant computational barrier to processing long sequences.

FASST models long-range dependencies by representing the sequence-to-sequence transformation as a continuous-time linear system. This system is discretized into a convolutional kernel, and the sequence output is computed efficiently in O(N log N) time via the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Our key innovation lies in a parameterization of the state transition matrices based on diagonal plus low-rank structures, which ensures stability and allows for efficient computation while maintaining high expressive power. We show that this formulation is equivalent to a specific type of structured global convolutional kernel.

"Accurate uncertainty quantification in deep learning is critical for safety-sensitive applications, yet posterior inference over the high-dimensional weight space of neural networks is notoriously difficult. We introduce Functional Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (fSGLD), a scalable MCMC algorithm that performs posterior sampling directly in the space of functions, rather than the parameter space. This approach is motivated by the observation that many different weight configurations can map to nearly identical functions. fSGLD defines a Langevin diffusion process on the function space, guided by a prior (e.g., a Gaussian Process) and the data likelihood. We derive a practical implementation where each sampling step involves a functional gradient update, realized efficiently through a neural network parameterization and leveraging techniques from kernel methods. By exploring the typically lower-dimensional and better-behaved functional posterior, fSGLD mixes more rapidly and effectively captures a diverse ensemble of predictive functions. On various regression and out-of-distribution detection tasks, fSGLD provides better-calibrated uncertainty estimates and higher predictive log-likelihoods than weight-space SGLD, variational inference, and deep ensembles.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Functional Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics for Scalable Uncertainty Quantification in Deep Neural Networks

The core of our system is a differentiable forward-chaining inference engine that evaluates the logical entailment of these clauses against background knowledge and examples. By relaxing logical operations into continuous functions, the entire process of rule generation, selection, and evaluation becomes differentiable, enabling gradient-based optimization over the combinatorial space of logic programs. This allows δILP to learn human-readable logical theories directly from noisy, high-dimensional inputs. We demonstrate its efficacy on relational learning tasks such as knowledge base completion and graph-based reasoning, where it not only achieves high predictive accuracy but also provides verifiable symbolic explanations for its inferences.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Differentiable Inductive Logic Programming with Neural Program Synthesis for Explainable Reasoning

To respect the fundamental symmetries of crystal structures, the denoising network is designed to be E(3)-equivariant, ensuring that the generation process is invariant to rotations, translations, and reflections of the atomic arrangement. We explicitly incorporate periodic boundary conditions into the diffusion and denoising steps to handle the lattice structure. For inverse design, we employ classifier-free guidance to steer the reverse diffusion process toward generating candidates that exhibit desired physical properties (e.g., formation energy, band gap).

We identified hundreds of differentially methylated regions (DMRs), primarily in intragenic CpG islands, that correlated with sustained upregulation of morphological defense genes. Crucially, a significant subset of these epialleles, along with the defensive phenotype, persisted for three generations in a predator-free environment, demonstrating transgenerational inheritance. Our results indicate that environmentally sculpted DNA methylation patterns can act as a heritable substrate for natural selection, facilitating rapid adaptive responses on ecological timescales.

Hsp90 knockdown induced a dramatic increase in phenotypic variance for thermotolerance. Through bulk segregant analysis and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping on experimentally evolved populations, we identified numerous polymorphic loci with previously undetected effects that contributed to the rapid acquisition of high thermotolerance. These loci were enriched for functions in cell wall integrity and protein folding pathways.

We analyzed high-coverage whole-genome sequences from 15 diverse ethnolinguistic groups across ISEA, applying coalescent-based modeling and novel methods for detecting archaic haplotypes. Our analyses reveal at least three distinct Denisovan introgression pulses into the ancestors of modern Papuans and other ISEA populations. These introgressed haplotypes are functionally enriched in genes related to lipid metabolism and immune response, suggesting local adaptation. The divergence times between these Denisovan lineages imply a deep and complex population structure in Pleistocene Asia.

Using target-enrichment sequencing of hundreds of nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptor genes in the host and effector proteins in the pathogen, we identified clear signatures of co-evolutionary dynamics. Host NLR loci exhibited high levels of balancing selection, maintaining diverse resistance alleles within populations. Conversely, pathogen effector loci showed strong evidence of positive directional selection and frequent presence/absence polymorphism, indicating an evolutionary imperative to evade host recognition.

We identified recurrent signatures of positive selection in genes associated with neuropeptide signaling (e.g., vitellogenin, insulin/IGF-1) and epigenetic regulation (e.g., DNA methyltransferases). Furthermore, cis-regulatory regions of genes involved in caste determination showed accelerated evolution in eusocial lineages compared to their solitary relatives.

Despite different autosomes being captured, the neo-Y chromosomes exhibited striking convergence. All showed rapid gene loss, accumulation of repetitive elements, and heterochromatinization, forming distinct evolutionary strata correlated with the timing of recombination suppression. Critically, we observed the parallel evolution of a dosage compensation mechanism involving enrichment of histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation (H4K16ac) on the single neo-X in males, partially restoring transcript levels to autosomal-ancestral states.

By integrating single-cell ATAC-seq and RNA-seq from developing pharyngeal jaws across multiple species, we reconstructed a core GRN for jaw specification. We demonstrate that this network is highly modular. Core modules responsible for fundamental patterning (e.g., chondrogenesis) are deeply conserved, thus constraining the available phenotypic space. In contrast, peripheral modules controlling features like tooth shape and muscle attachment points show significant interspecific variation in transcription factor binding sites and enhancer activity.

This framework leads to a proof that X_G is e-positive for all unit interval graphs, thereby confirming a significant special case of the Stanley-Stembridge conjecture. Our methodology fuses techniques from the representation theory of the symmetric group S_n with combinatorial properties of parking functions, revealing a deep structural connection between graph coloring and plethystic calculus.

The connectivity of this cell complex is shown to provide a robust lower bound on the hypergraph's chromatic number. Our main theorem establishes that if the (k-1)-adjacency complex is (m(k-2)-1)-connected, then the chromatic number is at least m+1. The proof relies on a high-dimensional equivariant mapping argument, analogous to the use of the Borsuk-Ulam theorem in the graph case, applied to a continuous map from the complex to a specific Euclidean space.

Our proof circumvents the need for the full machinery of combinatorial Hodge theory. Instead, we develop a novel inductive argument based on specific contraction and deletion operations that are shown to preserve the sparse paving property under controlled conditions. This is achieved by analyzing the algebraic structure of the corresponding Chow ring and demonstrating that the required Hard Lefschetz-type properties are satisfied.

We consider sets A in a finite group G of bounded exponent and establish a power-law upper bound on the size of A if it contains no non-trivial three-term progressions of the form (x, xg, xg^2). The proof utilizes a non-abelian variant of higher-order Fourier analysis, defining Gowers uniformity norms relative to the group's commutator structure. A key technical innovation is the development of a non-abelian arithmetic regularity lemma, which decomposes functions into a structured part related to nilsequences derived from a nilpotent filtration of G, and a pseudorandom part. This work overcomes significant obstacles in generalizing additive combinatorial methods beyond the abelian setting and opens a path toward solving analogous problems for longer arithmetic progressions in general groups.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Matematik,Generated,Higher-Order Fourier Analysis and Roth's Theorem in Non-Abelian Groups

While existence is known for specific congruence classes, the general case remains open. We present a new recursive construction based on affine planes over finite fields that proves existence for a new infinite family of orders v such that v ≡ 3^k (mod 18) for prime power k.

We explicitly demonstrate that the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for entanglement entropy arises naturally from the network's connectivity, where the minimal surface in the bulk corresponds to the minimal number of tensor network bonds that must be cut to bisect the boundary state. By introducing local perturbations to the boundary conformal field theory (CFT), we observe corresponding metric perturbations in the bulk geometry, consistent with Einstein's equations at the linearized level.

We observe a dynamical scaling of the spin susceptibility, χ''(Q, ω) ~ (ω/T)^α, with a fractional exponent α that is nearly independent of momentum transfer. This behavior is indicative of a quantum-relaxational, locally critical state. The observed spin-resonance peak, a hallmark of the superconducting state, weakens but persists above T_c, smoothly evolving into the pseudogap's characteristic magnetic response.

"We experimentally demonstrate the phenomenon of photon blockade in a cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) system, comprising a single Cesium atom strongly coupled to a high-finesse Fabry-Pérot optical cavity. Operating in the strong coupling regime, where the coherent atom-photon coupling rate 'g' exceeds both the atomic decay rate 'γ' and the cavity field decay rate 'κ', the Jaynes-Cummings ladder of dressed states exhibits significant anharmonicity. The absorption of a single photon shifts the cavity resonance frequency, thereby preventing the absorption of a second photon. We verify this blockade effect by measuring the second-order intensity correlation function g^(2)(τ) of the transmitted light, observing strong photon antibunching with g^(2)(0) = 0.18 ± 0.04.

"The perception of dissonance in atonal music cannot be fully explained by traditional theories of harmonic interval ratios. This study investigates the hypothesis that listeners rely on lower-level acoustic cues and statistical properties of the audio signal. We conducted a listening experiment where participants rated the perceived tension of excerpts from atonal works by Schoenberg, Berg, and Webern. Subsequently, we performed a computational analysis of the same excerpts, extracting features including spectral centroid, spectral flux, and pitch-class entropy. A multiple regression analysis reveals that a combination of high-frequency spectral flux (a proxy for timbral roughness) and pitch-class set entropy are the strongest predictors of perceived tension ratings (R² = 0.78, p < .001). This finding suggests that in the absence of a stable tonal framework, listeners' judgments of dissonance are strongly influenced by the moment-to-moment timbral instability and harmonic unpredictability of the musical surface.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Perceptual Correlates of Timbral and Harmonic Dissonance in Post-Tonal Music: An Analysis of Spectral Flux and Information Entropy
"This paper introduces a novel unsupervised method for automated music structure segmentation based on Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA). Traditional approaches using self-similarity matrices often struggle to capture hierarchical structures. Our method computes recurrence plots from chroma features at multiple temporal resolutions. For each scale, we compute RQA measures such as Determinism (DET) and Laminarity (LAM), which quantify the degree of periodic and repetitive structures. A novelty curve is then derived from the rate of change of these RQA measures across the analysis window. Peaks in this multi-scale novelty curve indicate significant changes in musical texture and patterning, corresponding to structural boundaries. When evaluated on the SALAMI dataset, this approach significantly outperforms standard novelty-based methods and Laplacian segmentation, showing particular strength in identifying both fine-grained phrase boundaries and large-scale formal sections with a single, unified algorithm, achieving a 15% relative improvement on the 3-second F-measure.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Multi-Scale Recurrence Quantification Analysis for Unsupervised Music Structure Segmentation
"Assessing the complexity of a jazz improvisation is a challenging task for music theorists. We propose a novel approach using tools from topological data analysis, specifically persistent homology. A solo is transformed into a multi-dimensional point cloud representation, with dimensions corresponding to pitch height, metric position, and harmonic context (distance from chord tones). We then compute the persistent homology of this point cloud, which captures the birth and death of topological features (e.g., connected components, loops) as a proximity parameter is varied. The resulting persistence diagrams and Betti curves provide robust, scale-invariant signatures of melodic and harmonic structure. An analysis of solos from John Coltrane's 'sheets of sound' period versus Miles Davis's modal period reveals distinct topological fingerprints, quantitatively distinguishing Coltrane's high-density harmonic navigation from Davis's spacious, motivic development, thus offering a powerful new empirical lens for stylistic analysis.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Quantifying Improvisational Complexity in Jazz Solos using Persistent Homology
"Modeling the complex, ambiguous harmonic syntax of late-Romantic music poses a significant challenge for computational musicology. This paper presents a comparative evaluation of two probabilistic modeling paradigms: traditional variable-order n-gram models and modern Transformer-based neural networks. Using a curated corpus of harmonically analyzed works by Wagner, Mahler, and Strauss, we trained both model types to predict chord progressions. We evaluate their performance based on cross-entropy (perplexity) and their ability to generate stylistically plausible harmonic sequences. While n-gram models capture local dependencies effectively, the Transformer architecture, with its self-attention mechanism, proves significantly more adept at learning long-range voice-leading patterns and functional relationships in highly chromatic contexts. Its superior performance suggests that the underlying syntax of this repertoire is better characterized by hierarchical, non-adjacent dependencies than by simple Markovian chains, offering new insights into the cognitive processing of complex tonal music.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Probabilistic Models of Harmonic Syntax: A Comparative Analysis of N-gram and Transformer Architectures on Late-Romantic Chromaticism
"The role of non-Mendelian inheritance in speciation remains a contentious frontier in evolutionary biology. This study investigates the contribution of transgenerational epigenetic modifications, specifically DNA methylation patterns, to the establishment of reproductive isolation. Using a high-throughput, bisulfite sequencing approach on experimentally diverged lineages of the stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus), we identify hundreds of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that are stably inherited for multiple generations in the absence of continued selection pressure. We demonstrate that several of these DMRs are associated with genes controlling mate preference and hybrid developmental compatibility. Furthermore, our findings reveal paramutation-like phenomena where epigenetic states are transmitted from hybrids to purebred individuals, effectively creating a cascade of reproductive incompatibility. Our results provide compelling evidence that epigenetic inheritance can generate rapid and stable post-zygotic and pre-zygotic barriers, offering a viable mechanistic basis for sympatric speciation models that do not rely exclusively on strong disruptive selection on genetic loci.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Transgenerational Epigenetic Inheritance as a Driver of incipient Sympatric Speciation
"Phenotypic plasticity is often underpinned by canalization, a process that buffers development against genetic and environmental perturbations. We explore the evolutionary consequences of decanalization, where environmental stressors reveal cryptic genetic variation (CGV). Utilizing a Drosophila melanogaster model, we subjected isogenic lines to thermal stress, followed by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to map loci associated with novel morphological phenotypes. We demonstrate that the molecular chaperone Hsp90 acts as a key capacitor for CGV, its compromised function under stress unveiling polygenic variation affecting bristle number and wing venation. Subsequent rounds of artificial selection on these revealed phenotypes led to rapid genetic assimilation, where the trait becomes constitutively expressed even after the stressor is removed. This study empirically validates that the release and subsequent selection of CGV is a potent mechanism for rapid adaptation, allowing populations to traverse adaptive landscapes and occupy novel ecological niches far more quickly than predicted by de novo mutation rates alone.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Decanalization of Cryptic Genetic Variation by Environmental Stress Facilitates Rapid Adaptive Evolution
"The Red Queen hypothesis posits that antagonistic coevolution drives continuous adaptation. We test this prediction by analyzing the genomic signatures of selection in a classic host-pathogen system: Arabidopsis thaliana and the oomycete Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis. Through comparative population genomics of 50 host and pathogen strains, we identified loci under intense selective pressure. Using McDonald-Kreitman tests and dN/dS ratio calculations, we found strong evidence of recurrent positive selection on the host's Nucleotide-Binding Leucine-Rich Repeat (NLR) genes and the pathogen's RXLR effector proteins. Furthermore, we observed patterns of balancing selection at several key resistance loci in the host, indicative of frequency-dependent selection maintaining polymorphism. Our results depict a molecular arms race characterized by rapid selective sweeps on novel recognition genes and the long-term maintenance of diverse resistance alleles, providing a detailed genomic portrait of the dynamic interplay shaping host-parasite interactions and maintaining genetic diversity within populations.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Genomic Signatures of a Coevolutionary Arms Race: Positive Selection on Effector-Receptor Loci in a Plant-Pathogen System
"The evolution of altruistic worker castes in eusocial insects remains a central paradox, traditionally explained by kin selection (inclusive fitness). An alternative framework, multilevel selection, emphasizes selection acting on groups (colonies). We integrate these perspectives using a phylo-transcriptomic approach across 30 species of hymenoptera representing multiple independent origins of eusociality. By reconstructing ancestral gene expression states and mapping changes onto the phylogeny, we identify a conserved suite of genes whose regulation diverged at the transition to eusociality. These genes, involved in metabolism, foraging, and ovarian function, show signatures of selection consistent with a trait-group model. Our analysis reveals that while high relatedness (a prerequisite for kin selection) is the ancestral state, the subsequent evolution of the superorganism is driven by colony-level selection on the expression of these key genes, effectively subordinating individual fitness to colony productivity. This provides a unified view where kin selection facilitates the origin, and multilevel selection shapes the elaboration, of complex sociality.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Reconciling Kin and Multilevel Selection: Phylo-Transcriptomic Evidence for the Evolution of Eusociality in Hymenoptera
"The rapid radiation of animal phyla during the Cambrian explosion has left a legacy of short internal branches in the metazoan tree of life, confounding phylogenetic reconstruction. Here, we utilize a massive phylo-transcriptomic dataset, comprising over 1,200 orthogroups from 110 species, including newly sequenced enigmatic taxa like Ctenophora and Xenacoelomorpha, to resolve these deep relationships. Using site-heterogeneous mixture models that mitigate long-branch attraction artifacts, our analysis robustly places Ctenophora as the sister group to all other Metazoa. By mapping the evolution of key developmental transcription factor families onto this new topology, we demonstrate a stepwise assembly of the bilaterian gene regulatory network (GRN) toolkit. We show that major innovations in the Hox and Wnt signaling pathways predate the last common bilaterian ancestor, but their coordinated deployment in axis patterning was a critical enabler of the morphological diversification observed in the Cambrian fossil record.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Phylo-Transcriptomics Resolves Deep Metazoan Phylogeny and the Cambrian Diversification of Developmental Gene Regulatory Networks
"Adaptive radiations are hallmarks of evolutionary innovation, yet the genetic sources of their underlying variation are often debated. We investigate the contribution of reticulate evolution to the unparalleled species flock of Lake Victoria cichlids. Using whole-genome sequencing of over 200 species, we applied admixture graph and ABBA-BABA statistical methods to test for ancient gene flow. Our results reveal a complex history of hybridization between divergent riverine lineages that seeded the lake radiation. We identify numerous introgressed haploblocks containing genes associated with key ecological traits, including pharyngeal jaw morphology and visual pigments (opsins). These introgressed alleles provided novel combinations of functional variation that were subsequently sorted into distinct eco-morphological forms by strong ecological selection. This work demonstrates that hybridization is not merely a homogenizing force but can be a potent creative engine, providing the genetic substrate for rapid and extensive adaptive radiation.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,The Role of Ancient Introgression in the Explosive Adaptive Radiation of African Cichlid Fishes
"A fundamental question in evolution is the predictability of adaptive trajectories. Are they governed by deterministic selection or contingent upon the stochasticity of mutation and drift? We addressed this by analyzing 12 replicate populations of Escherichia coli from the Long-Term Evolution Experiment (LTEE) after 50,000 generations. Whole-genome, time-series sequencing reveals striking parallelism at the phenotypic level, with all populations showing increased fitness and similar metabolic shifts. However, at the genotypic level, the picture is more complex. While some genes (e.g., pykF, nadR) were mutated in most replicates, indicating strong selective targets, the specific mutations were often unique, and the temporal order of their fixation was highly variable. Furthermore, pervasive clonal interference and strong epistatic interactions between early and late mutations demonstrate that historical contingency profoundly shaped the genetic architecture of adaptation. Our findings suggest that evolution is repeatable in its general outcomes but highly idiosyncratic in its underlying genetic solutions.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Parsing Contingency and Determinism in Microbial Evolution: Parallelism at Multiple Levels in a Long-Term Experiment
"Genomes are not cooperative monoliths but are rife with intragenomic conflict driven by selfish genetic elements (SGEs). We investigate the coevolutionary dynamics between a Segregation Distorter (SD) meiotic drive complex in Drosophila melanogaster and the host's genomic defense systems. SD encodes a gene product that incapacitates sperm lacking the complex, thus violating Mendelian inheritance. Using population genomic and functional assays, we show that the fitness cost of SD is counteracted by an array of suppressors, primarily amplified loci within the PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway. We find evidence of a rapid arms race, with novel SD variants escaping piRNA targeting and new piRNA clusters evolving to recognize them. Our mathematical models, parameterized with empirical data, predict cyclical dynamics in allele frequencies and show that under certain demographic conditions, drive systems can escape suppression and fix, potentially leading to population extinction.

"Ancient DNA (aDNA) analysis has revolutionized paleoanthropology but is often limited by thermal degradation beyond 100,000 years.

Using high-resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), we successfully sequenced collagen type I (COL1A1 and COL1A2) and other proteins from a 400,kyr-old Homo heidelbergensis fossil from Sima de los Huesos, Spain. Phylogenetic inference based on these ancient protein sequences, which are more resilient to degradation than DNA, robustly places this hominin on the Neanderthal lineage after its divergence from the Denisovan lineage. Furthermore, we leveraged patterns of asparagine deamidation as an independent molecular clock to corroborate the fossil's antiquity.

This study investigates the role of antagonistic pleiotropy, where alleles beneficial for one trait are deleterious for another. We combine theoretical modeling using a Fisherian Geometric Framework with empirical data from a quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping experiment in divergently selected lines of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Our model predicts that as populations adapt, they approach a Pareto front where any further improvement in one fitness component necessitates a trade-off in another. The empirical data strongly support this prediction: we identified multiple QTLs with pleiotropic effects on fecundity and longevity that opposed the direction of selection. These loci substantially limited the response to selection and explain the rapid deceleration of fitness gains observed in the experimental lines. Our results underscore that understanding the pleiotropic nature of mutations is essential for predicting evolutionary trajectories and the limits of adaptation.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Antagonistic Pleiotropy as a Fundamental Constraint on the Rate and Direction of Adaptive Evolution
"The spatial organization of transcription is critical for precise gene regulation, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the RNA-binding protein Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) to form biomolecular condensates at super-enhancer regions. Using super-resolution microscopy and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), we show that FUS co-localizes with the Mediator complex and RNA Polymerase II within these transcriptional hubs. In vitro reconstitution assays reveal that the low-complexity domain of FUS is necessary and sufficient for phase separation, a process modulated by arginine methylation. Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) experiments in living cells confirm the liquid-like properties of these FUS-containing bodies. Genetic ablation of FUS disrupts super-enhancer architecture and leads to a significant downregulation of associated oncogenes. Our findings establish that LLPS driven by FUS is a fundamental mechanism for concentrating the transcriptional machinery, thereby ensuring robust expression of key cell identity genes.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation of FUS Orchestrates Transcriptional Condensates at Super-Enhancers
"The faithful inheritance of epigenetic states through cell division is fundamental to maintaining cellular identity. We have identified a novel long non-coding RNA, *CHROME* (Chromatin-Organizing Mitotic RNA Element), that acts as a scaffold for Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) to maintain H3K27 trimethylation at target loci during mitosis. Using integrated ATAC-seq, Hi-C, and RNA-seq analyses, we show that *CHROME* remains tethered to mitotic chromosomes and bookmarks hundreds of developmental gene promoters. Its depletion via antisense oligonucleotides results in a stochastic loss of H3K27me3 marks and subsequent aberrant gene activation in daughter cells. In vitro binding assays and cryo-EM structures reveal a specific RNA G-quadruplex motif within *CHROME* that directly engages the EZH2 subunit of PRC2.

"Mitochondrial quality control is essential for cellular homeostasis, with mitophagy being a primary clearance pathway for damaged organelles. Here, we identify the RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF185 as a novel, critical mediator of this process. Upon mitochondrial depolarization, RNF185 is recruited from the endoplasmic reticulum to the outer mitochondrial membrane in a PINK1-dependent manner. Using quantitative proteomics and in vitro ubiquitination assays, we demonstrate that RNF185 directly ubiquitinates multiple mitochondrial outer membrane proteins, including MFN2 and TOM20, with K63- and K48-linked chains. This dual ubiquitination serves to both arrest mitochondrial fusion and generate a robust scaffold for the recruitment of autophagy receptors such as NDP52 and Optineurin. CRISPR-Cas9 mediated knockout of *RNF185* in HeLa cells severely impairs the clearance of damaged mitochondria following CCCP treatment, leading to elevated ROS production.

"Translational regulation allows for rapid adaptive responses to cellular stress, but the role of transfer RNA (tRNA) modifications in this process is poorly understood. Using a combination of ribosome profiling and mass spectrometry-based tRNA sequencing (tRNA-seq), we systematically mapped changes in tRNA anticodon loop modifications in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* undergoing oxidative stress. We observed a rapid, stress-induced decrease in 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine (mcm5s2U) at the wobble position of tRNAs decoding Gln, Lys, and Glu. This hypo-modification impaired decoding efficiency specifically at their cognate AAA/GAA/CAA codons, as evidenced by increased ribosomal dwell time. Strikingly, genes enriched in these codons were disproportionately involved in cell growth and proliferation, while stress-response transcripts, which are poor in these codons, were translated more efficiently. This work demonstrates that dynamic regulation of tRNA modifications provides a mechanism for codon-biased translational reprogramming, enabling cells to selectively prioritize protein synthesis during environmental adaptation.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Dynamic tRNA Modification Landscapes Modulate Codon-Biased Translation During Cellular Stress
"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a prevalent internal modification on mRNA, but its role in co-transcriptional processes is unclear. Here, we investigate the interplay between m6A deposition and pre-mRNA splicing. Utilizing nascent RNA m6A-sequencing and iCLIP-seq, we show that m6A is deposited co-transcriptionally near 5' splice sites. We identify the splicing factor SRSF3 as a novel m6A 'reader' that preferentially binds m6A-modified RNA motifs via its RRM domain. Structural analysis and in vitro binding assays confirm a direct, high-affinity interaction. Functionally, m6A deposition by METTL3 promotes SRSF3 recruitment to nascent transcripts, enhancing the inclusion of specific cassette exons. Depletion of METTL3 or mutation of the SRSF3 RRM domain leads to widespread splicing defects, particularly for exons flanked by m6A-consensus sequences. Our results unveil a mechanism where m6A acts as a co-transcriptional mark that guides splicing factor recruitment, thereby directly coupling RNA methylation to the regulation of alternative splicing.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,N6-methyladenosine on Nascent RNA Regulates Co-transcriptional Splicing by Recruiting the SRSF3 Splicing Factor

We report the cryo-EM structure of the human telomerase holoenzyme bound to a G4-containing telomeric DNA substrate at 3.4 Å resolution. The structure reveals that the TEN domain of TERT acts as an anchor, while a previously uncharacterized accessory protein, TEP1, functions as a helicase-like processivity factor that actively unfolds the G4 structure. This unfolding repositions the 3' end of the DNA into the TERT active site for nucleotide addition. Single-molecule FRET experiments corroborate this stepwise unwinding and extension mechanism.

"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations are often viewed as pathogenic only above a high heteroplasmic threshold.

Using cybrid cell lines containing a gradient of heteroplasmy for a pathogenic mutation in the MT-ND5 gene (m.13513G>A), we show that even a 10-20% mutant load, which does not impair maximal respiratory capacity, is sufficient to subtly alter the cellular NAD+/NADH ratio. This redox shift activates SIRT1 and AMPK, initiating a retrograde signaling cascade that results in widespread transcriptional reprogramming, including the upregulation of antioxidant defense and nutrient scavenging pathways. Single-cell RNA-seq revealed that this response is uniform across the cell population, not an average of disparate states.

Our method utilizes cross-fitting, a sample-splitting technique that prevents overfitting and enables the use of arbitrary supervised learning algorithms (e.g., random forests, gradient boosting) for nuisance function estimation while preserving root-n consistency and asymptotic normality of the ATE estimator. We establish that under standard sparsity and regularity conditions, our estimator attains the semiparametric efficiency bound.

The scores are modeled using a mixed-effects framework, capturing individual temporal trajectories. The eigenfunctions of the covariance operator are estimated using a two-dimensional penalized spline smoother on a pooled covariance surface.

This non-linear transformation allows a standard stationary kernel (e.g., Matérn) in the warped space to induce a complex, non-stationary covariance structure in the original space. For computational tractability with large datasets, we embed this model within a stochastic variational inference framework using inducing points, which obviates the need for manipulating the full covariance matrix.

Our approach employs a sequential design strategy that adaptively selects design points to maximize the expected information gain. The core innovations are twofold: first, we use a Gaussian Process (GP) emulator as a surrogate for the computationally expensive model likelihood, drastically reducing the cost of utility estimation. Second, we approximate the intractable sequence of posterior distributions using Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods, which are more robust than traditional MCMC in this adaptive context. This synergistic combination of GP emulation and SMC facilitates the rapid identification of highly informative designs. We illustrate the method's effectiveness on a challenging pharmacokinetic model, showing that our designs yield substantially lower posterior parameter uncertainty compared to conventional design criteria.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,Bayesian Optimal Design for Non-Linear Models via Sequential Monte Carlo and Gaussian Process Emulation
"Estimating causal effects when network interference is present—i.e., one unit's treatment affects another's outcome—violates the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA) and poses significant methodological challenges. We propose a general framework for estimating direct and spillover effects under arbitrary interference structures. We introduce a flexible hierarchical exposure mapping that parameterizes a unit's exposure as a function of treatment assignments within multi-level network neighborhoods. Based on this mapping, we construct a doubly robust estimator for the average potential outcomes under different exposure conditions. This estimator uses two nuisance models: a generalized propensity score model for the exposure and a regression model for the outcome. It remains consistent if either model is correctly specified. We prove the estimator's asymptotic normality and demonstrate through simulations its superior robustness to model misspecification compared to IPW or outcome-regression estimators alone. The framework is applied to re-evaluate a networked public health intervention.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,Doubly Robust Estimation of Causal Effects under Network Interference using Hierarchical Exposure Models
"Conventional computational music theory, largely predicated on equal-tempered pitch-class sets, lacks robust methodologies for analyzing microtonal harmony. This paper introduces a novel framework that bridges this gap by establishing an isomorphism between the spectral representation of microtonal sonorities and abstract harmonic spaces. Utilizing a high-resolution Constant-Q Transform (CQT), we map audio signals into a point-cloud representation within a multi-dimensional feature space. We then employ techniques from topological data analysis, specifically persistent homology, to identify stable geometric structures within these point clouds that are invariant under different tuning systems. Applied to the works of Xenakis, Haas, and other microtonal composers, our method algorithmically reveals latent harmonic objects and transformational networks that elude traditional analysis. This spectrally-grounded approach provides a generalized and empirically verifiable paradigm for harmonic analysis, capable of quantitatively exploring the complex sonic architectures of post-tonal and microtonal music directly from the audio signal.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Spectral Isomorphism and the Computational Analysis of Microtonal Harmonic Structures

We propose a novel deep learning architecture, the Hierarchical Schenkerian Network (HS-Net), to tackle this problem. The model operates on a multi-scale chromagram derived from polyphonic audio and employs a series of nested Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units to explicitly model the foreground, middleground, and background levels of the tonal hierarchy. Preceded by a harmonic-percussive source separation front-end to enhance tonal clarity, the network is trained end-to-end on a newly created corpus of expert-annotated Bach chorales. Our system significantly outperforms existing rule-based and monolithic machine learning approaches in identifying fundamental lines (Urlinien) and key prolongational spans.

Timbral features, represented by Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), and symbolic harmonic labels are projected into a common high-dimensional vector space where proximity indicates semantic relatedness. By training the network to minimize a contrastive loss function, we enforce a mapping where specific instrumental combinations become associated with particular harmonic functions. Visualization of the latent space via t-SNE reveals distinct, interpretable clusters showing, for example, a strong affinity between brass textures and dominant prolongations. This methodology provides robust empirical evidence for the syntactical role of timbre and offers a new computational framework for analyzing the perceptual fusion of orchestral color and harmonic structure.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Timbral Semantics and Harmonic Function: A Corpus-Based Study of Orchestral Music Using Deep Co-embedding

We introduce a novel, psychoacoustically-informed model that operates directly on an audio-derived Onset Detection Function (ODF). The model comprises two components: a metrical clarity index and a rhythmic density index. Metrical clarity is quantified using the peak magnitude of a modified autocorrelation function of the ODF, which reflects the periodicity and stability of the underlying pulse. Concurrently, rhythmic density and syncopation are measured via the spectral entropy of the ODF’s short-term Fourier transform, capturing the predictability of rhythmic events. When evaluated against human listener ratings on a diverse corpus of musical stimuli, our composite model demonstrates a significantly higher correlation (r > 0.85) than prominent symbolic models. This framework provides a more perceptually valid and ecologically robust tool for the analysis of rhythmic feel and complexity in performed music.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,A Psychoacoustically-Grounded Computational Model of Metric Complexity via Autocorrelation and Spectral Entropy

We collected a dataset of synchronized, high-resolution motion capture data and fine-grained MIDI velocity and timing information from professional pianists. Using dimensionality reduction techniques, we construct two separate low-dimensional manifolds, one representing the gestural space (e.g., wrist velocity, torso rotation) and the other representing the musical expression space (e.g., micro-timing deviations, dynamic articulations). We then apply manifold alignment algorithms to learn a non-linear mapping between these two spaces. Our results show that this learned mapping can predict agogic timing with remarkable accuracy from kinematic data alone, revealing the biomechanical correlates of expressive devices like rubato.

For a given sequence of chords, we construct a multipartite graph where nodes represent notes and edges represent potential voice-leading connections. Edges are weighted according to a multi-faceted cost function incorporating principles of pitch proximity, registral coherence, and avoidance of forbidden parallels. An optimal voice-leading solution for the entire passage is then defined as the set of disjoint paths that visit each note exactly once, analogous to a Hamiltonian path problem. We present an efficient approximation algorithm based on integer linear programming to solve this NP-hard problem.

Our model, NR-NMF, constrains the temporal activation functions of harmonic dictionary atoms based on a probabilistic transition matrix. This matrix assigns higher probabilities to chord progressions that are parsimonious in neo-Riemannian tonal space (i.e., connected by P, L, or R transformations). The optimization objective is a modified Kullback-Leibler divergence that penalizes harmonically incoherent temporal activations. When applied to the task of separating piano from orchestra in Romantic concerti, NR-NMF achieves a statistically significant improvement in Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SDR) over conventional NMF and other semi-supervised approaches, demonstrating the efficacy of integrating high-level musical structure into low-level signal processing frameworks.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Neo-Riemannian-Guided Non-Negative Matrix Factorization for Harmonic Source Separation

This study utilizes a state-of-the-art deep learning model for multi-pitch estimation to extract high-resolution fundamental frequency (F0) contours for each instrument from a corpus of professional string quartet recordings. Following the demodulation of vibrato, we calculate the cent deviation of each note from its equal-tempered theoretical target. These deviations are then analyzed using a linear mixed-effects model to assess the influence of harmonic context, melodic function (e.g., leading-tone), and performer-specific tendencies. The statistical analysis reveals robust patterns of expressive tuning, including systematically sharpened leading tones and compressed minor thirds, that are consistent across performers.

At the lowest level, novelty functions are computed from chroma features, MFCCs, and a rhythmic onset pattern, respectively, identifying moments of significant change within each feature stream. These novelty curves serve as observations for a higher-level switching hidden Markov model (HMM), where the hidden states correspond to 'segment' or 'boundary'. The model learns the conditional probabilities of a structural boundary given concurrent novelty peaks, effectively performing multimodal data fusion. Priors can be incorporated to favor common formal archetypes.

Using a continuous wavelet transform, we decompose audio signals into bass, chordal, and percussive frequency bands. We then compute a time-varying phase synchrony index based on the cross-correlation of these band-limited amplitude envelopes. An analysis of a corpus of rhythms with human-annotated groove ratings reveals a strong positive correlation between our synchrony index and perceived groove. These findings are corroborated by an electroencephalography (EEG) experiment showing that high-groove stimuli elicit significantly stronger phase-locking of low-frequency neural oscillations in listeners.

Using this formulation, we calculate the entanglement entropy for various subregions of the boundary conformal field theory (CFT) and explore its connection to the dS entropy. Furthermore, we demonstrate how these entropy calculations constrain the reconstruction of the bulk geometry from boundary CFT correlators via the principle of subregion-subregion duality.

"We introduce a novel decoding algorithm for the topological toric code based on deep reinforcement learning (RL), specifically optimized for spatially correlated and anisotropic Pauli noise models. Conventional decoders, such as minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM), exhibit degraded performance when noise deviates from the idealized independent and identically distributed assumption. Our RL agent, structured as an actor-critic neural network, learns an optimal policy for applying correction operators directly from stabilizer measurement outcomes (syndromes). By training the agent on physically motivated noise configurations, we demonstrate a significant improvement in the logical error rate threshold, surpassing state-of-the-art decoders by up to 15% in high-anisotropy regimes. The decoder's policy implicitly learns the underlying noise correlations, adapting its corrective strategy without explicit modeling.

Utilizing the Euclidean path integral approach and heat kernel methods, we compute the effective action and derive the renormalized stress-energy tensor for the quantum field. The non-minimal coupling term, ξRφ², where R is the Ricci scalar, introduces significant modifications to the greybody factors and the particle emission rate. Our results show that for ξ > 1/6 (conformal coupling), the radiation flux is suppressed, effectively lowering the black hole's evaporation rate, while for ξ < 1/6, it is enhanced. These findings have profound implications for the late stages of black hole evaporation and the black hole information paradox, suggesting that interactions between quantum fields and spacetime curvature can fundamentally alter the semiclassical picture.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Kuantum,Generated,One-Loop Corrections to Hawking Radiation from Non-Minimally Coupled Scalar Fields on a Kerr-Newman Background

Operating in the resolved-sideband regime and employing a strong red-detuned pump tone, we induce ponderomotive squeezing of the mechanical motion below the zero-point fluctuation level. A second, weaker blue-detuned tone facilitates a two-mode squeezing interaction that generates robust entanglement. We quantify the entanglement using the logarithmic negativity, inferring a value of N = 0.41 ± 0.05 from the measured output field correlations, satisfying the inseparability criterion N > 0.

Our calculations self-consistently determine the electronic Green's functions and the effective pairing interaction mediated by spin and charge fluctuations. We find that strong antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations, arising from the on-site Coulomb repulsion on the copper sites, generate a robust attractive potential in the d_x²-y² pairing channel. The calculated superconducting transition temperature (T_c) and the momentum-space structure of the superconducting gap show excellent quantitative agreement with experimental data from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES).

Focusing on a model of a qubit channel subject to Pauli errors with Markovian memory, we formulate the problem of calculating the single-letter coherent information, maximized over an n-extension of the channel, as a series of semi-definite programs (SDPs). By leveraging the block-diagonal structure of the Choi-Jamiołkowski representation of the correlated channel and applying novel convex relaxation techniques, we are able to tighten existing bounds for n>2. Our method demonstrates that memory effects can, paradoxically, increase the quantum capacity beyond the memoryless limit in certain parameter regimes.

"We propose a novel experimental test of local realism using entangled neutral kaon pairs produced at a φ-factory, such as the KLOE experiment. The unique feature of the K⁰-K⁰ bar system is its intrinsic connection to CP violation, which we exploit to formulate a new type of Bell inequality. This Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (BCHSH) inequality is constructed from observables related to the time-dependent decay rates into semileptonic and pionic final states. The violation of the inequality is contingent on both quantum entanglement and the non-zero value of the CP-violating parameter ε_K. Our theoretical analysis shows that the predicted quantum mechanical violation is robust against typical sources of decoherence in this system, such as CPT violation and the ΔS = ΔQ rule violation. A successful experimental verification would not only constitute a loophole-free Bell test in a new physical domain but also demonstrate a profound link between fundamental symmetries and the non-local nature of quantum reality.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Kuantum,Generated,Probing Local Realism with Entangled Neutral Kaon Systems and CP Violation

By applying a sequence of rapid, high-fidelity control pulses derived from a gradient-ascent algorithm (GRAPE), we dynamically decouple the system from environmental noise, effectively creating a decoherence-free subspace. We calculate the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for the controlled system and show that it scales as N², the hallmark of the Heisenberg limit, whereas the unprotected QFI scales as N.

Here, we employ a phylogenomic approach, utilizing sequence capture data targeting thousands of ultraconserved elements (UCEs), to dissect the species boundaries within the intertidal gastropod genus Nucella. Coalescent-based species delimitation analyses, including BPP and MSC-based methods, consistently identify multiple deeply divergent, yet morphologically cryptic, lineages previously subsumed under a single taxonomic entity. Calibrated phylogenetic inference places these divergence events in the mid-to-late Miocene, temporally correlating with major paleogeographic shifts in coastal habitats. Analyses of genomic admixture suggest that while historical gene flow occurred, contemporary reproductive isolation is nearly complete.

By identifying nonsynonymous substitutions unique to the mammoth lineage in both alpha- and beta-globin genes and performing ancestral sequence reconstruction, we identified key variants under positive selection. In vitro functional assays of resurrected recombinant hemoglobin proteins demonstrate a significant left-shift in the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve, indicating increased oxygen affinity, a crucial adaptation for cold tolerance and hypoxia. Strikingly, the identified substitutions are functionally analogous to those found in extant high-altitude adapted artiodactyls, providing a remarkable case of convergent molecular evolution.

We tested this prediction by conducting temporal genomic analysis of an experimental coevolution study involving Arabidopsis thaliana and the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae. Leveraging time-series population sequencing, we tracked allele frequency trajectories of plant resistance (R) genes and pathogen effector proteins. We observed rapid, cyclical dynamics characterized by the fixation of novel R-gene alleles followed by counter-adaptive sweeps in corresponding effector loci, often leading to functional loss. This process is mediated by strong balancing selection at the metapopulation level, maintaining a diverse repertoire of recognition specificities. Our findings provide direct empirical evidence of a coevolutionary arms race at the molecular level, demonstrating that the tight genetic linkage between host receptors and pathogen effectors generates a highly dynamic selective landscape, driving rapid and perpetual adaptation.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Rapid Antagonistic Coevolution Driven by Effector-Receptor Dynamics in a Plant-Pathogen System

Our results reveal a profound reorganization of the 3D chromatin architecture around the HoxD gene cluster. While the genic content is highly conserved, the transition to tetrapods is correlated with the emergence of novel topologically associating domains (TADs) that bring distant enhancer elements into spatial proximity with posterior HoxD genes. This rewiring alters the spatiotemporal expression dynamics during limb bud development, enabling the patterning of autopod structures. This study demonstrates that the evolution of novel cis-regulatory landscapes, rather than the origin of new genes, was a principal mechanism driving a key macroevolutionary transition.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Cis-Regulatory Evolution of HoxD Cluster Architecture Underpins the Fin-to-Limb Transition
"The predictability of evolution is limited by stochastic mutation events and the complex interplay of genetic interactions. We analyzed the genomic dynamics of replicate populations from a 50,000-generation experiment with Escherichia coli to dissect the role of epistasis in shaping adaptive pathways. By reconstructing mutational histories via deep sequencing, we found that early beneficial mutations often had negative epistatic interactions with later available mutations, effectively constraining evolutionary trajectories. This phenomenon of 'epistatic ratcheting' channels populations down specific genetic paths, from which escape is improbable. Furthermore, clonal interference between competing beneficial mutations exacerbates this effect by favoring mutations with high immediate fitness gains, even if they lead to evolutionary dead ends on the rugged fitness landscape. Our results empirically demonstrate that historical contingency, mediated by a rugged epistatic landscape, profoundly restricts evolutionary outcomes, challenging simplistic models of adaptation.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Epistatic Ratcheting and Clonal Interference Constrain Adaptive Trajectories in a Long-Term Experiment
"The persistence of sexual reproduction, despite its inherent two-fold cost, is a central enigma in evolutionary biology. A leading hypothesis posits that recombination facilitates the efficient purging of deleterious mutations (i.e., Kondrashov's Hatchet). We developed sophisticated agent-based models to investigate how population structure influences this mechanism. Our simulations, incorporating varying levels of population viscosity and migration rates, reveal that the benefits of recombination are highly contingent on demographic context. In panmictic populations, recombination effectively reduces genetic load. However, in structured metapopulations with limited gene flow, Muller's Ratchet can operate efficiently within local demes, diminishing the relative advantage of sex. We show that a critical migration threshold exists, below which the benefits of recombination in breaking down negative genetic associations are nullified by spatial structuring. This finding suggests that the evolutionary maintenance of sex is not a universal constant but is instead dependent on the ecological and demographic landscape.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Stochastic Simulation Models Demonstrate Recombination's Efficacy in Purging Deleterious Mutations is Modulated by Population Structure

Applying state-dependent speciation and extinction (SSE) models within a Bayesian framework, we tested competing hypotheses regarding the influence of key innovations (e.g., flower symmetry, pollination syndromes) versus extrinsic abiotic factors. Our analyses, incorporating paleoclimatic proxy data, reveal that shifts in global temperature and atmospheric CO2 are the primary correlates of diversification rate variation. While key innovations show localized effects, their influence is dwarfed by climate-driven, clade-wide accelerations and decelerations in speciation and extinction rates. These results challenge the 'key innovation' paradigm, suggesting that for angiosperms, macroevolutionary dynamics are predominantly governed by ecological opportunity as dictated by the global abiotic environment, with intrinsic traits playing a secondary, facilitating role.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Diversification Rate Heterogeneity in Angiosperms is Tightly Linked to Paleoclimatic Shifts: A Bayesian Phylogenetic Comparative Analysis

Our analysis of orthologous protein interactions reveals a highly conserved network core, with peripheral nodes showing significantly higher rates of gain and loss. The evolutionary rate of a protein is strongly and inversely correlated with its degree centrality (number of interaction partners) within the network. This pattern is consistent with the pleiotropic constraint hypothesis, whereby highly connected 'hub' proteins are under stronger purifying selection due to their involvement in multiple biological processes.

Candidate genes within these regions are significantly enriched for functions related to xenobiotic metabolism, immune response, and lipid biosynthesis, suggesting convergent adaptation to anthropogenic pollutants, novel pathogens, and modified diets. These results provide strong evidence for replicated, rapid adaptation at the molecular level, demonstrating that urban landscapes act as powerful and predictable agents of selection.

Thousands of genes exhibited differential expression, yet few were taxonomically novel, supporting the 'reproductive ground plan' hypothesis, which posits that social pathways evolve via the co-option and rewiring of ancestral solitary behaviors. We found that differential DNA methylation, particularly in promoter regions of developmental and metabolic genes, is strongly associated with caste-specific gene expression.

By representing musical excerpts as paths within this multi-scalar graph, we employ Dijkstra's algorithm and Hamiltonian path-finding to identify structurally significant tonal trajectories and modulatory pivots. The methodology extends beyond conventional neo-Riemannian or diatonic spaces, accommodating microtonal and xenharmonic structures by dynamically generating the graph's topology from a given scale's interval vector. We validate our model against a corpus of late-Romantic and 20th-century compositions, demonstrating its superior explanatory power in modeling ambiguous or non-functional harmony compared to traditional Roman numeral or transformational analyses.

We formalize Schenkerian theory as a set of recursive grammatical rules where terminal symbols correspond to surface-level musical events and non-terminal symbols represent abstract prolongational and contrapuntal structures. Given a symbolic musical surface, our model utilizes a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, specifically Gibbs sampling, to efficiently explore the posterior distribution of possible analytic derivations. This probabilistic approach inherently manages analytical ambiguity by yielding a distribution of plausible readings rather than a single deterministic output.

This process forces the latent embedding to prioritize harmonic and rhythmic content over timbral information. Structural boundary detection is then performed by applying a kernel-based novelty function to the time-series of these timbre-invariant latent vectors. Evaluated on a diverse dataset including orchestral works, jazz improvisations, and electronic music, our system significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially on challenging tasks such as identifying formal sections across different arrangements or cover versions of the same piece.

These features, captured in persistence diagrams and barcodes, quantify the lifespan of topological attributes like connected components and loops, which correspond to recurring motifs and developmental sections. We then employ a kernel-based machine learning model on the space of persistence diagrams to cluster a large, unannotated corpus of Western classical music. The resulting clusters demonstrate a strong correlation with canonical forms (e.g., sonata, rondo, theme and variations), revealing emergent structural archetypes without prior training.

The factorization is optimized via a multiplicative update rule algorithm that integrates these constraints. The system decomposes a magnitude spectrogram into a set of spectral templates corresponding to instrument notes and their time-varying activations.

"Eukaryotic gene expression is exquisitely regulated by chromatin architecture, with histone modifications playing a pivotal role. This study elucidates the molecular mechanism by which a previously uncharacterized protein complex, designated ""Chromatin Compaction Factor 1"" (CCF1), interacts with the histone methyltransferase SETD2 to establish and maintain repressive chromatin states. We demonstrate that CCF1 selectively recruits SETD2 to specific genomic loci, facilitating the tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36me3) within heterochromatic regions. Loss-of-function studies employing CRISPR-mediated depletion of CCF1 reveal a significant reduction in H3K36me3 levels, concomitant with decreased heterochromatin density, aberrant transcription of silenced genes, and altered nuclear lamina associations. Mechanistically, CCF1 acts as a scaffold, bridging SETD2 to core nucleosomes and enhancing its catalytic efficiency, thereby driving localized chromatin compaction.

"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) constitute a burgeoning class of non-coding RNAs implicated in various cellular processes, often acting as miRNA sponges. Here, we identify circFOXO3 as a crucial regulator of autophagy in response to nutrient deprivation. Utilizing RNA sequencing and interactome analyses, we demonstrate that circFOXO3 is significantly upregulated under starvation conditions and functions as a molecular sponge for miR-29a. This sequestration liberates the target mRNA of miR-29a, ATG7 (autophagy related 7), leading to increased ATG7 protein translation and subsequent enhancement of autophagosome formation and flux. Overexpression of circFOXO3 promotes autophagic vesicle maturation and degradation, while its knockdown impairs these processes, rendering cells more susceptible to nutrient stress-induced apoptosis. Our data reveal a novel circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory axis involving circFOXO3, miR-29a, and ATG7, which precisely tunes autophagy activity to maintain cellular homeostasis.

This study investigates the IDR-driven phase separation behavior of the transcription factor SOX2, a key regulator of pluripotency. We demonstrate that specific low-complexity domains within SOX2’s intrinsically disordered regions are indispensable for its ability to undergo LLPS, forming dynamic transcriptional condensates enriched with co-activators and Mediator complex components. Mutational analyses disrupting these motifs abrogated condensate formation and significantly impaired SOX2’s transcriptional activity on downstream targets. Furthermore, super-resolution microscopy revealed that SOX2 condensates spatially organize enhancer elements, promoting their clustering and facilitating long-range chromatin interactions essential for robust gene expression.

Here, we identify a novel oncogenic splice variant of the Rho-GEF PREX2 (PREX2-ΔExon11) in MYC-amplified glioblastoma (GBM). This variant, characterized by the exclusion of exon 11, exhibits enhanced GEF activity towards Rac1 and Cdc42, leading to sustained activation of downstream MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways, which are critical for GBM proliferation and invasion. Mechanistically, we show that MYC amplification directly upregulates the splicing factor RBMX, which in turn promotes PREX2-ΔExon11 expression. Inhibition of RBMX or targeted knockdown of PREX2-ΔExon11 significantly attenuates tumor growth and sensitizes GBM cells to temozolomide both in vitro and in orthotopic xenograft models.

While dietary intake and ubiquitous synthesis are known, the specific role of the mitochondrial solute carrier SLC25A46 in regulating CoQ10 homeostasis and its impact on cellular bioenergetics remains underexplored. This study reveals that SLC25A46, a protein localized to mitochondrial outer-inner membrane contact sites, facilitates the de novo synthesis of CoQ10 by mediating the import of its precursor, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, into the mitochondrial matrix. Loss-of-function of SLC25A46 leads to significant depletion of endogenous CoQ10 levels, resulting in compromised mitochondrial complex I and II activity, reduced ATP production, and heightened susceptibility to oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. Reconstitution of SLC25A46 restores CoQ10 levels and rescues respiratory defects.

"Telomeres, nucleoprotein structures capping chromosome ends, are essential for genome stability, yet their repetitive G-rich sequences pose significant challenges to DNA replication. This study identifies RecqL4, a member of the RecQ helicase family, as a critical factor in resolving replication obstacles at telomeres. We demonstrate that RecqL4 is recruited to telomeric regions during S-phase in a TRF2-dependent manner. Mechanistically, RecqL4 unwinds G-quadruplex (G4) structures, which are prone to form within telomeric DNA, thereby preventing replication fork stalling and collapse. Depletion of RecqL4 leads to increased telomere fragility, accumulation of single-stranded DNA gaps, and enhanced activation of the ATR-CHK1 DNA damage response pathway specifically at telomeres. Furthermore, we show that RecqL4’s helicase activity is crucial for its function, as mutation of its catalytic domain abrogates its ability to maintain telomere integrity.

We discover that VPx functions as a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase, directly targeting and promoting the proteasomal degradation of STING (Stimulator of Interferon Genes). This interaction is mediated by a conserved motif within VPx that specifically recognizes STING and tags it with K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, leading to its rapid turnover. Overexpression of VPx abrogates type I interferon production in response to cytosolic DNA sensing, while its deletion significantly enhances antiviral immunity. Furthermore, structural modeling and mutational analyses identify key residues in VPx crucial for its E3 ligase activity and STING interaction.

Under such conditions, ""selfish"" overexploitation within a patch leads to local extinction, removing maladaptive strategies from the metapopulation and selecting for more prudent phenotypes in surviving patches. Conversely, high dispersal rates can homogenize strategies, potentially leading to global overexploitation.

"Mitochondrial dynamics, particularly inner membrane fusion orchestrated by OPA1, are pivotal for cellular bioenergetics. How OPA1 precisely modulates cristae ultrastructure to fine-tune oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) efficiency under metabolic stress, like hypoxia, is unclear. Our investigation reveals that acute hypoxia induces OPA1 cleavage and partial inner membrane fragmentation, leading to a transient decrease in electron transport chain (ETC) supercomplex assembly and ATP synthase activity. Paradoxically, sustained OPA1-mediated fusion under chronic hypoxia maintains cristae integrity, preserving OXPHOS efficiency and mitigating reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, thereby facilitating cellular adaptation. This adaptive mechanism involves OPA1 interaction with specific ETC components, optimizing electron flow and preventing mitochondrial uncoupling.

In a system of rapidly diversifying *Drosophila* species, we performed reciprocal crosses and genomic analyses to identify loci undergoing accelerated evolution under sexual conflict. Our findings demonstrate that divergence in male SFPs and female reproductive tract morphology correlates strongly with the onset of pre-zygotic isolation. Specifically, we localized several quantitative trait loci (QTL) implicated in post-copulatory, pre-zygotic barriers, where mismatched SFP-receptor interactions lead to reduced sperm viability and fertilization success in heterospecific crosses. This antagonistic arms race drives rapid evolutionary turnover at these loci, contributing significantly to reduced hybrid fitness and reinforcing assortative mating within nascent species.

"Endothelial cell senescence (ECS) is a critical contributor to cardiovascular aging and dysfunction, yet its intricate molecular underpinning remains incompletely understood. We investigated the role of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in ECS, identifying circFOXO3 as a significantly downregulated species during replicative senescence.

"This paper addresses the challenging problem of estimating sparse precision matrices in high-dimensional settings under potential heteroscedasticity and non-Gaussian errors. Standard penalized estimators, such as the graphical Lasso, often assume homoscedasticity and sub-Gaussianity, leading to biased and inconsistent inference when these assumptions are violated. We propose a novel robust penalized estimator, which leverages a rank-based measure of dependence combined with a modified `l_1` regularization on the entries of the precision matrix. Our theoretical analysis establishes rates of convergence for spectral norm consistency and entry-wise recovery under weaker moment conditions, demonstrating its robustness. Furthermore, we derive the asymptotic distribution of a debiased version, enabling valid hypothesis testing for individual edges.

"We investigate the dynamics of quantum information scrambling in a chaotic spin system using the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC). By implementing a protocol on a trapped-ion quantum simulator, we directly measure the OTOC, C(t) = ⟨W†(t)V†(0)W(t)V(0)⟩, for local Pauli operators W and V. In the chaotic regime, we observe an exponential growth of the OTOC at early times, C(t) ≈ 1 - ε exp(λ_L t), from which we extract the quantum Lyapunov exponent λ_L. Our results show a clear correlation between λ_L and the system's proximity to an integrable point, establishing the OTOC as a reliable experimental diagnostic for quantum chaos. Furthermore, the spatiotemporal propagation of correlations is shown to define a 'light cone' for information, consistent with the Lieb-Robinson bounds.

We model a qubit system subjected to environmental phase noise and apply a sequence of strong, frequent projective measurements in a basis different from the system's eigenbasis. Our theoretical analysis, based on a filter-function formalism, demonstrates that the measurement sequence effectively modifies the spectral density of the environmental noise as perceived by the qubit, leading to a quadratic suppression of decoherence. We experimentally validate this prediction using a superconducting transmon qubit, applying a series of rapid microwave pulses to enact the projective measurements. The measured coherence decay rate scales inversely with the measurement frequency, confirming the Zeno-like suppression. This technique offers a hardware-efficient method for dynamical decoupling and quantum error prevention, distinct from conventional spin-echo protocols, with broad applicability in quantum computing and sensing.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Kuantum,Generated,Dynamical Control and Suppression of Decoherence via the Quantum Zeno Effect

We show that from Alice's perspective, the entanglement is degraded because Rob's detector traces over a portion of the quantum field causally disconnected from him, an effect known as the Unruh effect. We compute the logarithmic negativity and concurrence for both scalar and fermionic field entanglement, revealing that the state becomes disentangled at a finite acceleration.

We analyze the Laplacian matrix of these rhythmic graphs to derive metrics of complexity, including the algebraic connectivity (Fiedler value), which correlates with the rhythm's structural coherence, and the spectral entropy, which quantifies its predictability and regularity. The framework is validated against a corpus of rhythms from diverse musical traditions, demonstrating its ability to distinguish between different metric structures and provide a continuous measure of complexity that aligns with perceptual studies.

We derive a universal upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, r, that is significantly stronger than current observational limits for a broad class of potentials, including monomial and Starobinsky-like models. Specifically, we show that consistency with both conjectures requires r < 10^-9 for canonical single-field inflation.

"Non-Hermitian systems, which effectively describe open systems with gain and loss, exhibit unique topological phenomena with no Hermitian counterparts. We theoretically investigate the topological band structure of a three-dimensional periodically driven photonic crystal with engineered gain and loss. The interplay of Floquet engineering and non-Hermiticity leads to the formation of exceptional points (EPs), where both eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce. We demonstrate that these EPs are not isolated points but form extended one-dimensional lines and two-dimensional surfaces in the combined momentum-parameter space. The topology of these exceptional nodal structures is characterized by a generalized Berry phase, which manifests in observable phenomena such as the non-adiabatic transport of light. Our analysis reveals that light propagating near these exceptional surfaces exhibits unidirectional amplification and extreme sensitivity to perturbations, opening possibilities for designing novel topological photonic devices like robust lasers and optical switches with enhanced functionalities.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Fizik,Generated,Non-Hermitian Topology and Exceptional Nodal Surfaces in a Periodically Driven Photonic Crystal

Using large-scale exact diagonalization and a time-dependent variational principle, we map the phase diagram as a function of driving frequency and disorder strength. We identify the MBL transition through multiple independent diagnostics, including the statistics of the Floquet eigenstate level spacing, the scaling of entanglement entropy, and the decay of local observables.

We identify an effective temperature tensor, T_eff, that is frequency- and wavevector-dependent, capturing the scale-dependent energy injection from active processes. This T_eff replaces the scalar thermodynamic temperature in the response functions, thereby restoring a FDT-like structure. We demonstrate that for a model of active Brownian particles, T_eff reveals anisotropic responses and long-range correlations not present in equilibrium systems.

For α exceeding the system's dimension d, the system thermalizes to a Gibbs ensemble, albeit with timescales that can be anomalously slow. However, for α < d, the system fails to thermalize on any accessible timescale, instead entering a long-lived prethermal state described by a quasi-local Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE).

We compiled a corpus of over 500 commercial recordings spanning from the early 20th century to the present. A novel score-to-performance alignment technique based on parametric time warping and constrained by a hierarchical beat-tracking model was developed to extract precise note-level onset deviations and MIDI-like velocity information from the audio. Statistical analysis of the derived microtiming profiles reveals a significant historical trend: a decrease in the variance of local tempo rubato and a more pronounced adherence to notated metrical structure in post-1960s recordings. Furthermore, we identify performer-specific dynamic palettes through clustering analysis of velocity contours, revealing distinct 'schools' of interpretation. Our findings provide quantitative evidence for a shift towards a more literalist interpretation of the musical score in modern performance practice, challenging qualitative historical narratives and providing a fine-grained empirical foundation for performance studies.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Microtiming and Dynamics in Chopin Mazurka Performances: A Cross-Decade Corpus Study using Parametric Time Warping
"Neo-Riemannian theory has successfully modeled parsimonious voice leading in tonal music using geometric spaces like the Tonnetz. However, extending these models to post-tonal and atonal repertoires presents significant challenges due to the absence of a diatonic background structure. This paper introduces a generalized geometric framework for analyzing voice leading in atonal contexts based on orbifold-based pitch-class spaces. We construct unique topological orbifolds for significant set-classes (e.g., hexachords) from the atonal literature, where geometric proximity corresponds to minimal voice-leading displacement under transposition and inversion (T/I operations). Using this framework, we analyze excerpts from works by Schoenberg and Webern, demonstrating that seemingly disjunct harmonic successions can be understood as maximally efficient, short-path trajectories within these bespoke geometric spaces. The methodology quantifies voice-leading parsimony in a context-sensitive manner, revealing a latent quasi-tonal coherence in early atonal compositions and providing a powerful new analytical tool for post-tonal music theory.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Voice-Leading Parsimony in Atonal Music: A Geometric Approach Using Orbifold-Based Pitch-Class Spaces
"State-of-the-art Automatic Music Transcription (AMT) systems, typically based on Convolutional or Recurrent Neural Networks, often produce musically implausible errors, such as harmonically inconsistent notes or discontinuous melodic lines. This paper proposes a novel transcription model that explicitly integrates music-theoretical principles of counterpoint to enhance performance. Our approach models the input time-frequency representation (e.g., a CQT spectrogram) as a graph, where nodes are time-frequency bins and edges encode potential melodic and harmonic relationships informed by rules of voice leading. We then employ a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to classify node activations (i.e., note presence). The GCN's architecture allows it to learn contextually, favoring note combinations that form consonant intervals and smooth melodic contours. Trained and evaluated on the MAPS dataset, our contrapuntally-informed GCN outperforms standard CNN-based baselines, particularly in reducing musically salient errors in complex polyphonic passages, thereby bridging the gap between signal-level processing and symbolic musical knowledge.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Contrapuntally-Informed Polyphonic Music Transcription using a Graph Convolutional Network
"Neo-Riemannian theory primarily focuses on a small set of canonical transformations (P, L, R) operating on major and minor triads within 12-tone equal temperament (12-TET). This paper presents a generalized algorithmic framework for the systematic enumeration and classification of all possible parsimonious, contextually-defined transformations in any N-tone equal temperament (N-TET) system. Our method utilizes principles from computational group theory to define a 'transformation search space' for a given chord type and N-TET system. It identifies all operations that preserve a maximum number of common tones while satisfying group-theoretic closure properties. Applying this algorithm to non-standard systems like 19-TET and 24-TET, we uncover novel transformation groups with rich, non-diatonic structures. The resulting exhaustive catalog of transformations provides a theoretical foundation for extending transformational analysis beyond its conventional tonal confines and serves as a compositional tool for exploring the unique voice-leading possibilities inherent in microtonal harmonic systems.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Algorithmic Enumeration and Classification of Non-Standard Neo-Riemannian Transformations in N-TET Systems
"The subtle, non-notated variations in timing and dynamics are crucial components of expressive musical performance. This research introduces a method for identifying and characterizing performer-specific 'expressive gestures' from audio recordings. We first extract high-resolution contours of micro-dynamics (log-RMS energy) and agogic accents (deviations from a beat-synchronous grid) from score-aligned performance data. The Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is then applied to these contours. The resulting scalograms provide a multi-resolution representation that localizes expressive events in both time and scale, effectively distinguishing short, sharp accents from broader phrase-level shaping. By applying template matching and clustering algorithms in the wavelet domain, we successfully identify recurring, idiosyncratic gestural patterns unique to individual performers across different pieces. This methodology allows for a quantitative stylometry of performance, enabling objective comparisons between artists and providing a powerful tool for understanding the microstructure of musical expression beyond simple statistical measures of rubato or dynamic range.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Characterizing Performer-Specific Expressive Gestures using Continuous Wavelet Transform on Micro-Dynamic and Agogic Contours
"The relationship between a conductor's gestures and the resultant orchestral sound is fundamental to ensemble performance, yet it remains poorly understood from a quantitative perspective. This paper presents a cross-modal analysis correlating high-resolution conductor motion-capture data with multi-channel orchestral audio recordings. We extract kinematic features from the conductor's gesture, including baton tip velocity, acceleration, and spatial trajectory complexity. Simultaneously, we compute a suite of audio features from the orchestral recording, such as spectral centroid, dynamic range, and inter-instrument synchronization jitter. A deep canonical correlation analysis (DCCA) model is employed to learn a shared latent space that maximizes the correlation between the two modalities. Our results reveal strong, non-linear mappings between specific gestural archetypes and measurable sonic outcomes. For example, sharp, vertical beat patterns are highly correlated with precise tutti onsets and increased high-frequency energy in the brass section.

"The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), a Class B G-protein coupled receptor, is a critical regulator of glucose homeostasis. Therapeutic agonists exhibit signaling bias, preferentially activating G-protein pathways over β-arrestin recruitment, yet the structural basis for this phenomenon remains elusive. Here, we present the 3.1 Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of human GLP-1R in a complex with the biased agonist exendin-P5 and a nucleotide-free Gαsβγ heterotrimer. The structure reveals that exendin-P5 induces a distinct outward displacement of the intracellular end of transmembrane helix 6 (TM6), which is less pronounced than that induced by non-biased agonists. This specific conformation reconfigures the cytoplasmic cavity, optimizing interactions with Gαs while simultaneously occluding key residues required for GRK-mediated phosphorylation and subsequent β-arrestin engagement.

"Transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes is often characterized by stochastic bursts of activity, but the underlying molecular mechanisms controlling burst kinetics are poorly understood. We demonstrate that the Mediator complex, a key coactivator, undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) to form biomolecular condensates at super-enhancers. Using in vitro reconstitution, single-molecule tracking, and high-resolution microscopy in murine embryonic stem cells, we show that the intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of the MED1 subunit are essential for phase separation. Phosphorylation of specific serine residues within these IDRs by CDK8 modulates the material properties of the condensates, transitioning them from a dynamic liquid-like state to a more gel-like state. This transition alters the residence time of RNA Polymerase II, thereby tuning transcriptional burst frequency and amplitude.

CRISPRi-mediated knockdown of CHRONOS leads to a progressive, genome-wide erosion of H3K27me3 domains over multiple cell cycles, reactivating key developmental genes.

Utilizing ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) in human cells subjected to ER stress, we mapped translational landscapes with codon resolution. Our analysis revealed stress-induced, preferential translation of thousands of upstream open reading frames (uORFs), many of which were previously unannotated. This uORF translation robustly repressed synthesis from the downstream, canonical coding sequence of critical housekeeping and growth-promoting genes.

This is characterized by fork stalling and the accumulation of RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops) and G-quadruplex structures. Furthermore, electron microscopy of replication intermediates reveals aberrant telomeric structures consistent with unresolved replication stress.

Using proximity-labeling proteomics, we found TRIM50 is robustly recruited to mutant Huntingtin (mHTT) inclusion bodies. We demonstrate that TRIM50 directly ubiquitinates aggregated mHTT with K63-linked chains, which then serve as a high-affinity binding platform for the autophagy receptor p62/SQSTM1. Depletion of TRIM50, but not other related TRIM-family members, leads to a significant accumulation of mHTT aggregates and increased cytotoxicity, a phenotype that cannot be rescued by proteasome inhibition.

In a panel of isogenic colorectal cancer cell lines, AZD9574 induced profound synthetic lethality in ATM-deficient cells. Mechanistically, DNA fiber analysis and comet assays revealed that the potent trapping activity of AZD9574 causes widespread replication fork stalling and collapse, generating complex DNA lesions that are uniquely reliant on ATM for resolution. The resulting genomic instability leads to mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis.

By performing m6A-sequencing (MeRIP-seq) at high temporal resolution throughout the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into cortical neurons, we uncovered dynamic waves of m6A deposition. An early wave, catalyzed by the METTL3/METTL14 writer complex, targets transcripts encoding key neuroprogenitor maintenance factors, including SOX2 and PAX6. This methylation recruits the YTHDF2 reader protein, promoting rapid mRNA decay and facilitating a timely exit from the progenitor state.

This modification does not target them for proteasomal degradation but instead promotes their sequestration into insoluble aggregates, resulting in impaired neurotransmitter release and significant synaptic dysfunction. These findings link CMA dysregulation directly to synaptotoxicity, revealing a novel mechanism whereby failure of selective autophagy compromises the synaptic vesicle cycle and contributes to neurodegeneration.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Chaperone-Mediated Autophagy Dysregulation Impairs Synaptic Proteostasis through Aberrant Ubiquitination of SNARE Complexes

"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant internal modification on eukaryotic mRNA, influencing RNA stability, splicing, and translation. Its role in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) fate decisions remains poorly understood. Through conditional knockout of the m6A writer component METTL3 in murine HSCs, coupled with m6A-seq and 3'-end sequencing, we demonstrate that m6A deposition is critical for maintaining HSC quiescence and self-renewal. Mechanistically, METTL3-mediated m6A marking in the 3' UTR of key splicing factor transcripts, including SRSF2 and U2AF1, recruits the reader protein YTHDF2, which paradoxically stabilizes these transcripts by preventing their cleavage at proximal alternative polyadenylation (APA) sites. Loss of m6A leads to premature cleavage and polyadenylation, producing truncated, unstable transcripts. This results in global splicing dysregulation and forces HSCs towards myeloid differentiation.

"Accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis relies on the precise regulation of sister chromatid cohesion, which is maintained at the centromere until anaphase onset. The Chromosomal Passenger Complex (CPC), with its catalytic subunit Aurora B kinase, is a master regulator of this process. Using a FRET-based biosensor and quantitative phosphoproteomics, we uncovered a Plk1-dependent positive feedback loop that hyperactivates Aurora B at inner centromeres during metaphase. We show that Plk1 phosphorylates the CPC subunit INCENP, enhancing its affinity for Aurora B and triggering a surge in kinase activity. This localized hyperactivation is essential for phosphorylating the cohesin protector Sgo1, preventing its premature cleavage by separase. Inhibition of either Plk1 or this specific INCENP phosphorylation leads to catastrophic loss of centromeric cohesion and widespread aneuploidy.

The core innovation is a graph-based parsing module that interprets the network's output to reconstruct hierarchical Schenkerian structures, identifying the Urlinie, Bassbrechung, and intermediate prolongational levels. We trained the system on a newly curated dataset of annotated recordings of J.S. Bach's chorales and Chopin's preludes. The results demonstrate a significant improvement over existing symbolic-domain methods in correctly identifying fundamental structures, achieving a 78% F1-score on foreground-level reductions.

"While neo-Riemannian theory has extensively modeled chromatic harmony through geometric transformations on the Tonnetz, its relationship with musical timbre remains largely unexplored. This study investigates the correlation between timbral feature trajectories and neo-Riemannian operations in late-Romantic orchestral music. We apply a suite of timbral descriptors, including Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), spectral centroid, and spectral flux, to audio recordings of works by Wagner and Strauss. A synchronized analysis maps these timbral vectors to sequences of P, L, and R transformations derived from harmonic analysis. Using canonical correlation analysis (CCA), we reveal statistically significant covariances between specific timbral shifts and transformational types. For instance, P-transformations correlate strongly with increases in spectral brightness, while L-transformations are associated with changes in timbral homogeneity. These findings suggest that orchestration and timbre are not merely coloristic but are syntactically integrated with harmonic function, offering a new, multi-parametric dimension to transformational theory.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Timbral Feature Trajectories as Correlates of Neo-Riemannian Transformations in Late-Romantic Orchestral Music

We formulate a novel Hamiltonian whose ground state corresponds to a maximally parsimonious and rule-compliant voice-leading solution between given harmonic pillars. Each potential melodic motion is encoded as a qubit, and constraints—such as prohibitions on parallel fifths, unresolved dissonances, and improper melodic leaps—are encoded as penalty terms in the QUBO matrix. We tested this quantum-assisted framework on a D-Wave quantum annealer, analyzing complex polyphonic excerpts from Palestrina and Lassus.

A sophisticated pitch estimation algorithm first extracts fundamental frequencies and their prominent inharmonic partials. These observations serve as evidence in a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation that samples from the posterior distribution of possible cents-deviations for each of the twelve pitch classes. The model’s prior is informed by a corpus of known historical temperaments, including Pythagorean, meantone, and various well-tempered systems.

This paper employs manifold learning techniques to visualize the latent geometric space of musical form. We first compute a self-similarity matrix from a sequence of time-localized timbral and harmonic features (chromagrams and MFCCs) extracted from an audio recording. Subsequently, we treat this matrix as a weighted adjacency graph and apply Laplacian Eigenmaps, a non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithm, to project the musical structure onto a low-dimensional manifold. The resulting embedding provides an intuitive visualization where temporally distant but thematically related sections cluster together. We apply this methodology to a corpus of classical sonata-form movements, demonstrating that the learned manifold effectively separates exposition, development, and recapitulation sections into distinct geometric regions.

The core of our model is a transformer network with a cross-modal attention mechanism that learns to predict local tempo variations (agogic accents) in the audio based on specific notational contexts (e.g., harmonic tension, phrase boundaries, articulation marks) in the score. Trained on the Mazurka Project dataset, our model predicts expressive timing profiles that correlate highly with human performances (Pearson's r = 0.82), significantly outperforming baseline models reliant on audio features alone.

"We introduce a graph-theoretic framework for the analysis of voice-leading parsimony in polyphonic audio signals. The methodology begins with multi-pitch estimation to extract concurrent melodic streams from a complex audio mixture. These streams are modeled as nodes in a time-varying graph, where edges represent potential voice-leading connections between successive time frames. Edge weights are computed based on a psychoacoustically informed cost function that penalizes large melodic leaps, voice crossings, and harmonic dissonance. The problem of identifying the most coherent and parsimonious voice-leading is then framed as finding the minimum-cost path through this graph sequence, solved efficiently using a Viterbi-like algorithm. Applying this technique to Renaissance and Baroque polyphony, we demonstrate its ability to disambiguate complex textures and quantitatively measure voice-leading efficiency. The results align closely with established music-theoretic principles of smooth counterpoint, providing an objective, audio-based tool for stylistic and structural analysis.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,A Graph-Theoretic Framework for Parsimonious Voice-Leading Analysis in Polyphonic Audio

The resulting activation matrix reveals the temporal evolution and interplay of these timbral components throughout a piece. We apply this technique to Ravel's *Bolero*, successfully isolating individual instrumental families and tracing their entries and combinations.

"The dynamic exchange of histone variants is a cornerstone of epigenetic regulation, yet the precise mechanisms governing their deposition and impact on chromatin architecture remain partially elucidated.

Our analysis of millisecond-timescale trajectories demonstrates that FOXA1 binding locally decompacts condensed chromatin, transitioning the local environment from an anomalous to a more Brownian diffusion regime. This alteration in the physical landscape significantly reduces the residence time of ERα on non-cognate sites and increases the probability of target engagement through a series of short-lived interrogations.

Our results demonstrate that multivalent, low-affinity interactions between the arginine-rich motifs in FUS and nucleic acids are the primary drivers of LLPS, with the prion-like domain modulating the material properties of the resulting condensates. ALS-associated mutations in the FUS nuclear localization signal lead to its cytoplasmic mislocalization and prolonged residence in stress granules.

When targeted to the MYC oncogene promoter by specific guide RNAs, the dCas9-KRAB moiety initiates histone deacetylation and H3K9 trimethylation, creating a docking site for the fused MeCP2. This, in turn, recruits DNA methyltransferases, leading to de novo CpG methylation and long-term epigenetic memory of the repressed state.

Site-specific mutation of this lysine residue abrogates STN1 SUMOylation and impairs CST recruitment to telomeres following replicative stress. Consequently, cells expressing SUMO-deficient STN1 exhibit hallmarks of telomere dysfunction, including elongated C-strand overhangs, increased telomere fragility, and activation of the ATR-dependent DNA damage response.

We formulate a metrological protocol where the parameter to be estimated is encoded within the contextual correlations among a set of incompatible observables. The quantum Fisher information is shown to be directly proportional to a novel, robust measure of contextuality derived from the violation of a Kochen-Specker-type inequality.

"We introduce the concept of topological spacetime photonic crystals that exhibit a non-reciprocal bianisotropic response analogous to Willis coupling in continuum mechanics. The system is comprised of a dielectric lattice whose permittivity and permeability are modulated both in space and time with a carefully chosen relative phase, which explicitly breaks time-reversal symmetry without magnetic materials. Using a rigorous Floquet-Bloch mode analysis, we demonstrate that this spatiotemporal modulation induces an effective magneto-electric coupling and a momentum-asymmetric impedance, resulting in a non-reciprocal photonic band structure. For specific modulation parameters, the photonic bandgap acquires a non-trivial topological character, quantified by an integer Chern number, leading to the emergence of chiral, one-way electromagnetic edge states. These states are topologically protected against defects and disorder and exhibit robust unidirectional propagation. Our findings open a new avenue for designing integrated, all-dielectric non-reciprocal photonic devices such as topological insulators, circulators, and isolators based on dynamic modulation.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Fizik,Generated,Topological Spacetime Photonic Crystals with Non-Reciprocal Willis Coupling
"We investigate the dynamics of the inverse cascade of magnetic helicity in forced, three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence using high-resolution direct numerical simulations. In contrast to conventional models with continuous, homogeneous forcing, we study the system's response to intermittent, spatially localized injections of kinetic and magnetic helicity, mimicking energetic astrophysical phenomena like solar flares. Our results reveal that the inverse cascade process is fundamentally altered by the stochastic nature of the forcing. The growth of the large-scale magnetic field is not monotonic but proceeds through a series of rapid amplification events followed by periods of slow resistive dissipation. We analyze the evolving magnetic field topology using Lagrangian coherent structures and find that the inverse transfer is primarily mediated by the merger and reconnection of coherent helical flux tubes. A scale-dependent statistical analysis shows that intermittency in the forcing function generates strongly non-Gaussian probability distribution functions for magnetic field increments at large scales, a key signature absent in continuously forced systems.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Fizik,Generated,Intermittent Helicity Injection and its Role in the Inverse Cascade of Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence
"We develop a theoretical framework for the dynamics of eukaryotic chromatin, treating it as an active polymer system driven far from thermal equilibrium by ATP-dependent motor proteins. By extending established polymer physics models to include non-conservative forces and stochastic activity hotspots, we derive a generalized Fokker-Planck equation describing the evolution of the chromatin conformational probability distribution. Our model predicts that these active processes generate effective long-range correlations and non-equilibrium entropic forces that can cooperatively fold or unfold entire topologically associating domains (TADs). We subsequently connect these mesoscale conformational changes to epigenetic state transitions by coupling the polymer dynamics to a bistable model of histone mark modification. The system exhibits hysteretic switching between condensed (heterochromatin) and decondensed (euchromatin) states, governed by the motor activity level. Using principles from stochastic thermodynamics, we quantify the information-theoretic cost and entropy production rate required to maintain these non-equilibrium chromatin architectures, providing a physical basis for the stability and plasticity of the epigenetic landscape.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Fizik,Generated,Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics of Active Chromatin: Entropic Forces and Epigenetic State Transitions

The model leverages a generative process wherein foreground events are stochastically derived from more abstract middleground structures, which in turn are conditioned on a fundamental Ursatz. We employ a custom Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference algorithm to explore the posterior distribution of possible analyses given a musical surface. The model incorporates musically informed priors that encode principles of prolongation, voice-leading parsimony, and metrical stability.

We analyze a comprehensive database of isolated instrumental samples, extracting a suite of spectral descriptors including Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), spectral centroid, flux, and roll-off. Traditional clustering methods often fail to capture the nuanced, continuous nature of timbral perception. Instead, we utilize Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to embed the high-dimensional feature vectors into a low-dimensional space that preserves both local and global topological structure. The resulting manifold reveals salient organizational principles, showing distinct clusters for instrumental families, but also continuous pathways corresponding to perceptual blending and timbral gradients.

This research proposes a new methodology for its quantification by combining high-resolution onset detection with constrained Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for precise score-performance alignment. From this alignment, we extract a continuous stream of tempo and note-level durational deviations. To move beyond descriptive statistics, we employ invertible causal models to disentangle the influence of structural musical features (e.g., harmonic tension, melodic contour) from performer-specific stylistic signatures. The model is trained on a corpus of recordings by multiple concert pianists performing the same repertoire. Our results demonstrate the ability to isolate idiosyncratic rubato patterns and agogic accentuations, providing a robust performer 'fingerprint'.

We represent n-voice pitch-class collections as points in a toroidal configuration space. By analyzing a corpus of 20th-century contrapuntal works, we generate high-dimensional point clouds representing the realized voice-leadings. We then apply persistent homology to these point clouds to identify their underlying topological features, such as loops and voids, at various scales. These features correspond to recurring, non-trivial voice-leading transformations and cyclical patterns that are not apparent from surface-level analysis.

These features are then fed into a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network to model long-range temporal dependencies inherent in harmonic progressions. Crucially, we incorporate a self-attention mechanism that allows the model to dynamically weight the influence of different temporal contexts when making a chord prediction.

"Most computational rhythm analysis systems presuppose an isochronous metrical grid, a bias that limits their applicability to a vast range of world music traditions. This paper proposes an unsupervised method for discovering complex, non-isochronous metrical structures directly from audio recordings. The approach first calculates a novelty function from the signal's spectral flux. This function is then used to construct a self-similarity matrix (SSM), which reveals recurring rhythmic patterns as diagonal structures. To learn a compact representation of these patterns, we employ a 1D convolutional autoencoder trained on segments of the novelty curve. By clustering the resulting latent-space representations, our system can identify and classify characteristic rhythmic cells (e.g., tālas, usuls) without prior knowledge of the underlying metrical system.

"Classical models of sensory dissonance, based on spectral beating and critical bandwidth theory, are insufficient for explaining perceived tension in post-tonal and atonal music. We propose a hybrid psychoacoustic model that accounts for both physiological and cognitive dimensions of dissonance. The model's first component computes sensory roughness from the audio signal's partials using a time-varying extension of the Plomp-Levelt model. The second, cognitive component quantifies harmonic tension as information-theoretic surprisal. This is calculated using a probabilistic model of pitch-class set transitions, trained on a large corpus of atonal music to learn its statistical syntax. The final dissonance value is a weighted combination of the sensory and cognitive outputs. When validated against listener ratings for a curated set of atonal excerpts, our hybrid model demonstrates a significantly higher correlation with perceived dissonance than models based on either component alone.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Psychoacoustic Dissonance Revisited: A Hybrid Model Integrating Sensory Roughness and Information-Theoretic Surprisal for Post-Tonal Music

This study employs a multimodal approach to empirically investigate this link. We recorded a professional conductor leading an orchestra using a 3D motion capture system synchronized with a multi-channel audio recording. We extracted kinematic features from the conductor's baton trajectory (e.g., velocity, acceleration, gesture volume) and acoustic features from the orchestral audio (e.g., RMS energy, spectral centroid, attack sharpness). To model the relationship between these two feature sets, we applied Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), a statistical technique that finds maximally correlated linear projections of two multidimensional variables. The resulting canonical variates reveal strong correlations between gesture velocity and orchestral dynamics, and between gesture size and articulation, thus providing a quantitative mapping between gestural and acoustic expressive parameters.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Cross-Modal Analysis of Conductor Gestures and Orchestral Dynamics via Canonical Correlation Analysis

Standard NMF, however, often produces musically incongruous results. This paper introduces a constrained NMF framework that incorporates prior musical knowledge to improve performance. We impose a harmonicity constraint on the spectral basis vectors (the 'W' matrix), forcing them to resemble harmonic spectra, and a temporal sparsity constraint on the activation matrix (the 'H' matrix) to favor note-like events. This musically-informed factorization yields a more accurate multi-pitch transcription from complex audio mixtures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the learned spectral bases provide a rich, data-driven representation of instrumental timbre. By clustering these bases, we can perform automatic instrument identification within the mixture, offering a unified framework for both transcription and timbral analysis of polyphonic recordings.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Constrained Non-Negative Matrix Factorization for Polyphonic Music Transcription and Timbral Analysis

This allows the model to capture both short-range voice-leading conventions and longer-range functional relationships. We analyze the model's predictive performance and calculate the information rate (entropy) of different harmonic idioms, providing a quantitative measure of their syntactic complexity and predictability. The model also allows for the identification of points of high surprisal, which often correspond to moments of significant musical interest, such as deceptive cadences or unexpected modulations, thus formalizing a key aspect of music-theoretic analysis.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Modeling Tonal Syntax with Variable-Order Markov Models and Information Rate Analysis

Our model treats the temperament's cent deviations from equal temperament as latent variables to be estimated. The likelihood function is based on a spectrally-informed inharmonic partial series template, while the prior distribution over temperaments can be informed by historical treatises. Crucially, instantaneous frequency drift is co-estimated as a Gaussian Process, allowing the model to distinguish between intentional tuning choices and recording artifacts. We employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to derive the full posterior distribution for the temperament. Application of this methodology to early 20th-century piano recordings provides compelling quantitative evidence for the persistence of non-equal temperaments, offering a new paradigm for audio-based historical performance practice research.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Bayesian Inference of Historical Keyboard Temperaments from Early Audio Recordings using a Pitch-Drift-Aware Harmonic Model
"Standard audio analysis techniques often model timbre and harmony as orthogonal phenomena. We posit that they are perceptually and structurally co-modulated and introduce a Joint Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (JNMF) framework to explicitly model this interaction. Our approach factorizes a magnitude spectrogram into three component matrices: a set of spectral bases (timbres), their temporal activations, and a time-varying harmonic context matrix. The novelty lies in the regularization of the factorization process using a tonal prior derived from a probabilistic model of harmony based on the spiral array. This prior encourages the decomposition to yield spectrally coherent bases that are also harmonically consonant. When evaluated on complex orchestral excerpts, our regularized JNMF model demonstrates superior performance on both instrument identification and chord recognition tasks compared to unconstrained NMF and deep learning baselines.

The structural depth of a composition is quantified as the cumulative Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between successive layers, measuring the information added at each level of elaboration. Furthermore, we estimate the algorithmic (Kolmogorov) complexity of the transformational rules that generate the musical surface from the background, yielding a metric of compositional efficiency.

Audio features were extracted from these stimuli using machine listening techniques. A supervised learning model was then trained to predict human listener ratings of harmonic function, using both chroma features and the extracted timbral descriptors. Our results demonstrate that timbral features account for a significant portion of the variance in listener judgments, independent of pitch content.

"We determine a sharp threshold for the existence of a Hamilton cycle in the stochastic block model G(n,p,q) with two balanced communities of size n/2. The classical results of Bollobás and Komlós establish a sharp threshold for Hamiltonicity in the Erdős–Rényi model G(n,p). The community structure of the SBM introduces significant analytical challenges due to its inherent inhomogeneity. We prove that if np(1+q/p) → ∞ and np ≥ log n + log log n + ω(1), where ω(1) is any function tending to infinity, then G(n,p,q) is asymptotically almost surely Hamiltonian. Our proof integrates the 'sprinkling' method with a sophisticated absorption strategy tailored to the block model structure. We utilize a multi-stage vertex exposure process to carefully control the growth of paths across community boundaries, leveraging spectral properties of the expected adjacency matrix to guarantee the existence of necessary connector structures. This result precisely characterizes how community density influences the emergence of global spanning structures.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Matematik,Generated,A Sharp Threshold for Hamiltonicity in Stochastic Block Models
"We study the spectral properties of random n-lifts of a base graph G. A key question in spectral graph theory is the construction of graphs with large spectral gaps, known as expander graphs. We prove that if G is a d-regular graph with a sufficiently large second eigenvalue gap, then a random n-lift of G is, with high probability, a Ramanujan graph, thus achieving an optimal spectral gap. Our proof deviates from standard trace methods and instead relies on a novel application of eigenvalue interlacing theorems for partitioned matrices. We analyze the characteristic polynomial of the lifted graph's adjacency matrix by relating it to a matrix-valued polynomial whose coefficients are non-commuting random variables. By establishing concentration inequalities for the norms of these matrix products, we bound the new eigenvalues away from the 'trivial' eigenvalues inherited from the base graph. This provides a new constructive approach for families of near-optimal expander graphs with significant implications for network theory.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Matematik,Generated,Eigenvalue Interlacing and Spectral Gaps of Random Lifts of Graphs

Generalizing the classical edge-isoperimetry of Harper's theorem, our result relates the measure of the upper boundary of a set to a weighted sum of its elements' cardinalities. From this inequality, we derive a generalization of the Kahn-Kalai-Linial (KKL) theorem on the influence of variables. Specifically, we prove that for any Boolean function f defined on the poset, there exists an element whose influence is bounded below by Var(f) multiplied by a term depending on the poset's spectral gap and diameter. The proof involves analyzing the 'down-up' Markov chain on the poset and applying spectral techniques to its transition matrix. This result provides a powerful tool for analyzing threshold phenomena in non-uniform settings and has direct applications to the study of monotone properties on structured domains like the subset lattice with non-uniform probabilities.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Matematik,Generated,An Isoperimetric Inequality for Weighted Posets and a KKL-type Theorem

We prove a Szemerédi-type theorem for sparse sets that are pseudorandom in a Gowers uniformity sense. Let A ⊆ {1,...,N} be a set with density δ. We show that if A has a sufficiently small U^s(Z_N) uniformity norm for an appropriate s depending on the degree of the polynomial P, then A must contain a k-term polynomial progression. The proof combines the density increment strategy of Roth and Gowers with a quantitative version of the Bergelson-Leibman polynomial recurrence theorem. We develop a 'polynomial regularity lemma' that allows us to decompose the indicator function of A into a structured part, which is constant on a polynomial nilsequence, and a uniformly random part. This demonstrates the robustness of higher-order Fourier analysis in detecting algebraic configurations within sets lacking uniform global density.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Matematik,Generated,Polynomial Progressions in Sparse Pseudorandom Sets

We investigate the existence of resolvable (v,4,1)-balanced incomplete block designs (BIBDs) with a hole of size h. Such designs are equivalent to group divisible designs of type h^u, where v = hu. The necessary conditions for existence are v, h ≡ 4 (mod 12) and v ≥ 4h. This paper almost completely settles the existence question by proving these necessary conditions are sufficient for all v > C*h for some absolute constant C. The proof is based on a combination of recursive PBD-closure arguments and direct constructions using finite fields. We introduce a new 'frame-based inflation' technique that combines starter blocks from base groups with resolvable structures derived from affine planes of order 4.

This framework provides a bridge between classical oriented matroid theory and tropical geometry. A tropical oriented matroid is defined by a sign function on the cocircuits of a matroid that satisfies a tropical analogue of the Graßmann-Plücker relations. Our main result establishes a fundamental duality theorem: the set of all realizable tropical oriented matroids on a given ground set forms a polyhedral complex that is combinatorially equivalent to the secondary fan of a specific zonotope. This is proven by showing that the chirotope of a realizable tropical oriented matroid corresponds to the initial forms of the Plücker coordinates under a specific valuation.

Our focus is the case where k=3 and the number of colors c is large. Previous bounds relied primarily on the Lovász Local Lemma. We present a novel probabilistic construction that combines a random coloring with a carefully designed alteration phase. The initial coloring is chosen to minimize certain monochromatic substructures, and then a derandomized alteration algorithm is applied to eliminate the remaining forbidden progressions. This hybrid approach allows us to show that WR(3; r, c) > c^(r^2-r-o(1)) for fixed r and large c, significantly improving upon the existing exponential bounds.

We demonstrate that A(z) is not D-finite, precluding standard P-recursive enumeration techniques. Instead, we employ advanced methods from analytic combinatorics. By analyzing the kernel of the functional equation, we locate the dominant singularity z_c of A(z) and determine its algebraic nature. A detailed singularity analysis reveals the asymptotic behavior of the coefficients [z^n]A(z), proving that the number of such permutations of length n is asymptotically C * ρ^n * n^(-γ), where ρ and γ are algebraic constants we explicitly compute.

The core of our approach is a contrastive objective that maximizes the mutual information between corresponding representations from different modalities while simultaneously minimizing the statistical dependency among latent factors within each representation. This is achieved by augmenting a standard InfoNCE loss with a total correlation penalty term, approximated using a neural discriminator network. This dual objective forces the model to encode shared semantic information (e.g., object identity) separately from modality-specific information (e.g., visual texture or audio timbre). The resulting representations demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on downstream tasks like zero-shot classification and cross-modal retrieval, and quantitative evaluations confirm their superior disentanglement properties, enhancing both interpretability and transferability.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Disentangled Representation Learning via Information-Theoretic Cross-Modal Contrast

CIRL optimizes a minimax objective where a representation encoder is trained to be invariant across environments while a set of environment-specific predictors compete to maximize predictive accuracy. We provide theoretical guarantees that under certain identifiability assumptions, the learned representation captures the true causal structure.

Our approach leverages cross-fitting and Neyman-orthogonal moments to construct an estimator that is insensitive to first-order errors in the nuisance function estimations—namely, the propensity score and conditional outcome models. We employ sparse learners, such as the LASSO, for these nuisance components. The proposed CATE estimator is shown to be asymptotically Gaussian and achieves the semi-parametric efficiency bound under standard sparsity and overlap conditions, facilitating valid confidence intervals. This theoretical guarantee holds even with imperfect nuisance models, provided one is consistently estimated at a sufficient rate.

To assess statistical significance, we develop a permutation testing procedure that correctly accounts for the complex dependencies inherent in the data-to-topology transformation. We formally prove that our permutation scheme provides asymptotic control over the Type I error rate under the null hypothesis of identical underlying distributions.

To overcome the curse of dimensionality, we employ graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn a low-dimensional embedding of each unit's joint treatment and covariate profile. A propensity score, representing the probability of observing a specific embedding, is then estimated. Stratification on this learned propensity score allows for balancing complex exposure patterns, enabling unbiased estimation of direct and indirect (spillover) effects.

The PTE is defined through a joint optimization of a trimmed negative log-likelihood function and an L1-penalty. This formulation is non-convex, but we develop a computationally efficient algorithm that iterates between identifying potential outliers and solving a weighted penalized regression, which provably converges to a stationary point. Theoretically, we establish that the PTE possesses a high breakdown point and achieves near-optimal statistical error rates, matching the minimax rate for sparse GLMs under standard regularity conditions.

Genome-wide association studies linked these emergent traits to previously neutral or weakly deleterious alleles within complex gene regulatory networks. When subjected to novel selective pressures, populations with compromised Hsp90 function exhibited accelerated rates of adaptation, effectively converting cryptic variation into adaptive innovation.

The introgressed segment shows extreme allele frequency differentiation and an extended haplotype homozygosity signature consistent with a hard selective sweep post-admixture. Functional genomic analyses reveal that the archaic allele alters a key hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) binding site, leading to a blunted erythropoietic response that mitigates the risk of polycythemia at altitude.

Whole-genome sequencing revealed that distinct, parallel mutations in cell cycle regulatory genes underpinned this convergent phenotype. However, the subsequent evolution of a germ-soma division of labor occurred in only a subset of lineages and was contingent upon the specific initial mutation and subsequent ecological feedbacks.

Coalescent-based species tree analyses robustly support the Ctenophora-sister hypothesis. However, analyses of individual gene trees reveal pervasive phylogenetic conflict across the genome, with a significant proportion of loci supporting the alternative Porifera-sister topology.

Using high-density linkage maps and comparative phylogenetic methods, we found a strong positive correlation between a species' mean recombination rate and its prevalence of avian malaria (Plasmodium spp.). This association was particularly pronounced in genomic regions enriched for immune-related genes, such as the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC).

We developed a genomic offset model that uses the degree of mismatch between current and future projected allele frequencies to predict population vulnerability. This model demonstrates that peripheral populations at the southern range edge possess low adaptive potential and high maladaptation risk.

"The origin of novel morphological structures is a hallmark of macroevolution. The insect wing, a key innovation, is hypothesized to have evolved from either the dorsal body wall or proximal leg segments of an ancestral crustacean. We used comparative transcriptomics and functional genomics (CRISPR-Cas9) in the wingless crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis and the winged beetle Tribolium castaneum to investigate the deep homology of wing development. We demonstrate that the core gene regulatory network (GRN) controlling wing specification in insects, including transcription factors like vestigial (vg) and scalloped (sd), is deeply conserved and functions in the lateral body wall of the crustacean embryo. This suggests that the entire network was co-opted from a pre-existing developmental module. Subsequent diversification, particularly the recruitment of downstream effector genes, then drove the morphogenesis of the novel wing structure, providing a clear example of how evolutionary novelty arises through the redeployment of ancient genetic toolkits.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Co-option and Divergence of a Conserved Gene Regulatory Network Underlies Insect Wing Evolution
"Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is a major evolutionary force in prokaryotes, but its quantitative impact on eukaryotic genomes remains debated. We conducted a comprehensive phylogenomic analysis across 120 genomes of free-living protists from diverse supergroups. Using stringent phylogenetic incongruence tests and accounting for endosymbiotic gene transfer, we identified over 5,000 robust cases of bacteria-to-eukaryote HGT. These acquired genes are not randomly distributed but are significantly enriched for functions in metabolic pathways, particularly carbohydrate metabolism and detoxification, which are often absent in non-HGT-recipient sister taxa. Functional expression of a transferred bacterial cellulase in a Naegleria host confirmed its role in conferring a novel trophic capability. Our results demonstrate that HGT is a continuous and potent mechanism for eukaryotic innovation, allowing microbial eukaryotes to rapidly acquire novel metabolic functions and adapt to new ecological niches, thereby challenging the conventional view of vertically inherited genomes.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Pervasive Horizontal Gene Transfer from Bacteria Fuels Metabolic Innovation in Eukaryotic Protists
"Traditional pitch estimation algorithms, optimized for 12-tone equal temperament (12-TET), exhibit significant performance degradation when applied to microtonal music, particularly works employing just intonation (JI). This paper introduces a novel deep learning architecture, the Sub-Harmonic Convolutional Neural Network (SH-CNN), designed for high-resolution pitch estimation in non-12-TET contexts. Our model operates on a finely-grained constant-Q transform (CQT) and incorporates a learnable sub-harmonic summation layer inspired by psychoacoustic models of pitch perception. This layer explicitly models the harmonic relationships inherent in JI systems. We train and evaluate the SH-CNN on a newly curated dataset of synthesized and recorded JI performances, demonstrating a substantial reduction in cent deviation error compared to state-of-the-art pitch trackers like CREPE and pYIN.

"The precise tuning temperament used in historical keyboard performances is a critical, yet often unrecoverable, aspect of historically informed practice. This research presents a probabilistic framework for inferring historical temperaments directly from polyphonic audio recordings. We formulate a Bayesian model where the latent variables are the fundamental frequencies of all 12 pitch classes, constrained by a prior distribution over a dictionary of well-documented historical temperaments (e.g., Meantone, Well-Tempered systems). Using a multi-pitch estimation front-end to extract spectral evidence, we employ a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, specifically Gibbs sampling, to approximate the posterior distribution of the temperament parameters. Applied to a corpus of harpsichord recordings, our method successfully identifies the most probable temperament with high confidence, outperforming methods based on simple histogram analysis of pitch deviations.

This paper proposes a novel representation using hypergraphs to capture the multi-part contrapuntal relationships that define the style. Unlike simple graphs that model pairwise interactions, our hypergraph model represents each simultaneous sonority as a hyperedge connecting the constituent note vertices. We then define a set of hypergraph metrics quantifying contrapuntal characteristics, such as intervallic dissonance preparation, voice-crossing frequency, and adherence to formal cadential patterns. By applying this framework to a digital corpus of motets by Josquin des Prez, we demonstrate its ability to automatically identify points of structural imitation and cadential articulation with high precision.

We enhance the standard NMF objective function with a temporal-group sparsity constraint (L2,1-norm regularization), which encourages the activation matrix to exhibit block-like structures corresponding to consistent timbral segments. This approach effectively identifies sections characterized by distinct instrumentation or vocal textures. We evaluate our algorithm on the SALAMI dataset, demonstrating significant improvements in F-measure scores for boundary detection over conventional chromagram-based NMF and self-similarity matrix approaches, particularly for orchestral and electronic music.

We then compute several complexity metrics, including Shannon entropy, Lempel-Ziv complexity, and the mutual information between parameter streams, to characterize the degree of predictability and statistical interdependence within a composition. Analyzing Webern’s Symphony, Op. 21, and Boulez’s Structures Ia, our results reveal significant quantitative differences in their organizational strategies, despite both employing integral serialism.

The first stage employs a spectro-spatial factorization model that leverages both inter-channel level and time differences to perform an initial coarse separation of sources based on their panoramic position. The resulting components are then characterized by a high-dimensional timbre feature vector derived from a pre-trained deep convolutional autoencoder. In the second stage, we apply a hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm to these feature vectors to group components originating from the same instrumental section (e.g., first violins, cellos). Evaluated on a dataset of annotated orchestral excerpts, our system significantly outperforms baseline methods based solely on spatial cues or monophonic NMF, demonstrating the critical synergy of integrating spatial and timbral information.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Computational Aural Scene Analysis for Orchestral Music via Spectro-Spatial Source Separation and Hierarchical Clustering

Our model takes two input streams: a sequence of phoneme-level fundamental frequency (F0) contours representing the melody, and a sequence of contextual word embeddings (e.g., BERT) representing the lyrics. Through a cross-attention mechanism, the model learns to associate specific melodic gestures (e.g., rising pitch, vibrato) with semantic features of the corresponding words. We train the model on a large-scale dataset of aligned vocal tracks and lyrics. The learned attention weights serve as a quantitative measure of melo-semantic correspondence.

"Traditional models of harmonic progression often rely on discrete, rule-based systems that struggle to capture the nuances of tonal syntax. This research reconceptualizes harmonic analysis within the framework of geometric deep learning. We first construct a graph representation of tonal pitch space, where nodes are chords and edges are weighted by psychoacoustically-informed voice-leading distances, effectively defining a discrete approximation of a tonal manifold. We then employ a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to learn a continuous vector embedding for each chord that reflects its functional role within this geometric space. Trained on the chord sequences of the Bach chorales, the GNN learns embeddings that cluster according to harmonic function (e.g., tonic, dominant). This learned representation is then utilized in a downstream recurrent model for harmonic generation, which produces stylistically coherent progressions that respect voice-leading principles, significantly outperforming baseline n-gram models in qualitative evaluations.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Geometric Deep Learning on Tonal Pitch Space Manifolds for Harmonic Progression Analysis and Generation
"A musical performance is a complex entanglement of the symbolic score, the performer's expressive deviations (e.g., timing, dynamics), and the instrument's timbre. This paper presents a framework for disentangling these factors using Invertible Neural Networks (INNs). We design a multi-scale INN, structured as a normalizing flow, that learns a bijective mapping between the high-dimensional audio space (spectrograms) and a structured latent space. This latent space is partitioned into three independent subspaces, each conditioned to represent score, expressive parameters, and instrument identity, respectively. Due to the invertibility of the network, we can not only encode an audio recording into its disentangled components but also synthesize new audio by manipulating one latent subspace while keeping others fixed. This enables applications like expressive performance transfer between different instruments or applying a performer's style to a synthesized score, demonstrating a powerful and principled approach to generative modeling of musical audio.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,"Disentangling Score, Performance, and Instrument Timbre via Invertible Neural Networks"

The substitution matrix is empirically derived from cognitive models of melodic perception, weighting stable intervals higher than unstable ones. By computing pairwise alignment scores for a large corpus of folk tunes, we construct a distance matrix. This matrix is then used as input to phylogenetic tree reconstruction algorithms (e.g., UPGMA, Neighbor-Joining) to generate a 'phylo-memetic tree' that visualizes the hypothetical transmission history and family relationships among melodies.

We identify a parameter regime where the system evades thermalization, forming a prethermal Floquet many-body localized (MBL) phase. In this phase, the entanglement entropy exhibits a characteristic slow, logarithmic growth in time, and local observables fail to reach thermal equilibrium values over astronomically long timescales. This behavior contrasts sharply with both the ergodic phase, which thermalizes to an infinite-temperature state, and the static MBL phase.

"Explaining the remarkable generalization performance of over-parameterized deep neural networks is a central challenge in statistical learning theory. We derive novel PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds by connecting the training dynamics of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to a continuous-time stochastic differential equation (SDE). This perspective allows us to define a data-dependent prior distribution over the network weights that is centered on the SDE path corresponding to the SGD trajectory. The resulting generalization bound depends not just on the final learned parameters but on the entire optimization path. The bound explicitly incorporates the noise scale of SGD and the local geometry of the loss landscape, captured through the trace of the Hessian of the SDE's potential function. This information-theoretic approach provides a tighter, more informative alternative to complexity-based bounds. Our analysis suggests that the implicit regularization of SGD dynamics is a key driver of generalization. We empirically validate our bounds on benchmark image classification tasks, showing they are non-vacuous and correlate strongly with observed test error.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,PAC-Bayesian Generalization Bounds for Deep Neural Networks via Stochastic Differential Equations
"Standard pitch estimation algorithms, optimized for equal-tempered scales, exhibit significant deficiencies when analyzing microtonal music.

The model processes Constant-Q Transform (CQT) spectrograms through a CRNN backbone to extract temporal frequency representations. Crucially, a Bayesian final layer employing variational inference provides not only a point estimate for the fundamental frequency but also a corresponding epistemic uncertainty distribution. This probabilistic output allows for more nuanced interpretations of pitch, essential for analyzing the labile intonation characteristic of many traditions. We validate our framework on a newly curated dataset of Turkish Makam and Persian Dastgah recordings, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art models in both accuracy and the meaningful representation of pitch ambiguity.

By constructing clique complexes from these graphs, we apply persistent homology to track the evolution of topological features—specifically, Betti numbers representing n-dimensional holes—across varying scales. The resulting persistence diagrams serve as unique topological fingerprints of a composer's harmonic language, quantifying characteristics such as cyclic progressions and long-range structural dependencies that elude traditional Roman numeral or Schenkerian analysis.

From these representations, we extract instantaneous amplitude and frequency envelopes to quantify micro-timing deviations (expressive timing, *rubato*) and dynamic articulations at a sub-beat resolution. A novel algorithm is introduced to correlate these performance nuances with underlying harmonic tension, derived from a probabilistic model of tonal expectation (Krumhansl-Schmuckler).

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a generative probabilistic model, is then applied to this quantized corpus. The model discovers latent 'topics,' which are distributions over the musical vocabulary that correspond to recurring, stylistically significant melodic-harmonic formulae or 'licks.' The analysis reveals that these algorithmically discovered topics are musically meaningful, often correlating with specific harmonic functions (e.g., ii-V-I progressions) and exhibiting clear associations with individual improvisers (e.g., Charlie Parker vs. Dizzy Gillespie).

In contrast, our end-to-end model leverages a convolutional front-end to learn spectro-temporal features indicative of melodic salience and a subsequent recursive neural network to infer hierarchical relationships consistent with Schenkerian principles of prolongation and structural levels. Trained on a curated dataset of annotated Bach chorales and Lieder, the CRSN demonstrates a significant improvement in parsing accuracy for identifying the Ursatz (fundamental structure) and middleground prolongations compared to cascaded baseline models.

"This interdisciplinary study investigates the neural and psychoacoustic underpinnings of harmonic tension and resolution. We utilized functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity in musically trained subjects while they listened to specially constructed chord progressions that manipulated harmonic expectancy, including deceptive cadences, secondary dominants, and non-diatonic chords. Concurrently, we performed acoustic analysis on the stimuli, extracting features such as spectral flux, sensory dissonance (roughness), and tonal stability metrics derived from a key-finding algorithm. Our fMRI results reveal a significant correlation between activation in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and amygdala and moments of high harmonic expectancy violation. Furthermore, regression analysis shows that a composite acoustic model incorporating spectral dissonance and tonal ambiguity significantly predicts both subjective tension ratings and BOLD signal intensity in these auditory-cognitive processing regions. These findings provide empirical evidence for the neurobiological basis of tonal harmony, linking abstract theoretical concepts to measurable acoustic properties and their cognitive processing.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Psychoacoustic Correlates of Tonal Tension and Resolution: An fMRI Study of Harmonic Expectancy Violation
"The challenge of music source separation is amplified in densely textured orchestral music. This research explores the application of advanced Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) techniques for the unsupervised separation of orchestral sections from a single-channel audio mixture. We introduce a novel variant, Spatially Constrained Convolutive NMF (SC-CNMF), which incorporates prior knowledge of typical orchestral seating arrangements (spatial cues) and the characteristic spectral-temporal bases of instrument families (e.g., strings, brass, woodwinds). The model learns a dictionary of spectral templates and their corresponding activations, constrained to promote group-wise sparsity. Evaluated on a dataset of symphonic excerpts with corresponding multi-track recordings, our method demonstrates a marked improvement in Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SDR) and Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR) for separating entire orchestral sections compared to standard NMF and other state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, enabling new possibilities for musicological analysis and intelligent audio editing.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Non-Negative Matrix Factorization for Unsupervised Source Separation in Densely Orchestrated Symphonic Works

From this representation, we extract features quantifying microtiming deviations, including swing ratios, onset asynchronies, and articulation dynamics, at a sub-beat level. By correlating these expressive parameters with the underlying harmonic context and melodic contour, we develop a quantitative model of improvisational phrasing. Our analysis reveals soloist-specific timing signatures and systematic patterns where performers manipulate timing to articulate harmonic tension and release. This CWT-based approach provides a more nuanced characterization of rhythmic feel than traditional Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) methods, offering deeper insight into the embodied cognition and motor control involved in virtuosic jazz performance.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Quantifying Microtiming and Expressive Performance Deviations in Jazz Improvisation via Continuous Wavelet Transform

Our key innovation is the structuring of the GAN's latent space according to the Riemannian geometry of tonal pitch space, specifically using a toroidal manifold to represent pitch-class and intervallic relationships. This geometric prior biases the generator towards producing harmonically and melodically coherent sequences that respect the principles of common-practice tonality. The model, trained on the J.S. Bach chorale corpus, is tasked with generating missing measures within a given musical fragment. Both objective evaluation using metrics for tonal consistency and melodic contour, and subjective listening tests by expert musicians, confirm that our geometry-aware GAN significantly outperforms standard sequential GANs and LSTM-based models.

We map the F1/F2 vowel space for both production modes across a range of fundamental frequencies. Our results quantitatively confirm the phenomenon of vowel modification in singing, demonstrating a systematic migration of sung vowels towards a central acoustic space to maintain timbral consistency. Furthermore, we analyze the spectral clustering around 3 kHz to characterize the 'singer's formant,' showing its dependence on vowel type and pitch height.

"This work addresses the problem of matching musical score images to their corresponding audio performances, a key challenge in music information retrieval. We propose a cross-modal retrieval system based on a Siamese deep neural network architecture. One branch of the network, a Convolutional Neural network (CNN), processes CQT-based spectrograms extracted from audio recordings. The other branch, also a CNN, processes image patches of the corresponding sheet music. The network is trained using a contrastive loss function, which minimizes the Euclidean distance between embeddings of corresponding score-audio pairs while maximizing it for non-matching pairs. This forces the model to learn a shared, modality-invariant latent embedding space where scores and audio are represented by their essential musical content. Evaluated on a large dataset of piano music, our system achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in audio-to-score and score-to-audio retrieval tasks, significantly outperforming feature-based methods that rely on separate OMR and audio analysis pipelines.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Cross-Modal Retrieval of Musical Scores and Audio Recordings using Siamese Convolutional Neural Networks

This paper introduces a novel approach using Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to uncover robust structural patterns in such repertoires. We first compute self-similarity matrices from pitch-class distribution chromagrams of the audio. Then, instead of conventional novelty curve detection, we analyze the topology of these matrices using persistent homology. This technique captures multi-scale structural features by tracking the birth and death of topological components (e.g., loops, connected components) across changing similarity thresholds. The resulting persistence diagrams provide a rich, noise-resilient signature of a piece's formal organization. Applied to works by Schoenberg, Webern, and Ligeti, our TDA-based method successfully identifies sectional boundaries and recurring textural blocks that align with musicological analyses, demonstrating its superior efficacy for dissecting complex, non-tonal musical structures.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Topological Data Analysis of Self-Similarity Matrices for Structural Segmentation of Atonal and Post-Tonal Music

Audio-derived pitch information, extracted via a polyphonic pitch tracking algorithm, is mapped onto this theoretical graph space. By applying Dijkstra's and other shortest-path algorithms, we can computationally derive the most parsimonious pathways between non-adjacent harmonic structures, revealing latent voice-leading strategies that defy traditional surface-level analysis. The methodology is validated against canonical works by Webern and Ligeti, demonstrating its capacity to uncover deep structural coherence and quantify transformational complexity.

We employ Independent Subspace Analysis (ISA) on a time-frequency representation, specifically the Constant-Q Transform (CQT), to disentangle micro-timing deviations, dynamic articulations, and timbral modulations from the underlying note-pitch skeleton. The ISA model learns a basis of independent subspaces corresponding to distinct articulatory gestures (e.g., vibrato, legato, staccato) by exploiting higher-order statistical dependencies in the spectral data. The resultant activation vectors provide a high-resolution quantification of expressive choices, correlated against spectral flux and energy envelope derivatives. When applied to datasets of violin and vocal performances, the system successfully isolates agogic accents and dynamic shaping, offering a robust, data-driven tool for computational musicology and performance analysis that operates directly on the audio signal without requiring a canonical score.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Micro-timing and Spectral Flux: Decomposing Expressive Performance Parameters using Independent Subspace Analysis

Our model represents metrical levels (tactus, supermeter, sub-division) as latent state variables whose probabilistic transitions are conditioned by inter-onset intervals (IOIs) and acoustic accent features derived from the signal's energy envelope. Unlike beat-tracking models assuming a single, stable meter, our framework utilizes a particle filter to simultaneously track multiple competing metrical hypotheses, allowing it to robustly model nested tuplets, cross-rhythms, and metric modulations. The model's efficacy is demonstrated on a curated corpus of contemporary classical and West African drum ensemble recordings. The posterior probability distributions over the latent metrical states provide a quantitative measure of metrical ambiguity and stability over time, offering new insights into rhythmic perception and complexity.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Bayesian Inference of Metrical Hierarchy in Polymetric Audio Signals

This research investigates the modulation of perceived consonance by instrumental timbre using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on psychoacoustic data. We synthesized harmonic dyads and triads using a diverse library of instrumental samples and collected consonance ratings via a large-scale listening experiment. The CNN was trained to predict these ratings directly from the audio spectrograms. Saliency mapping and feature visualization techniques were then employed to interpret the network's learned representations, revealing that spectral characteristics such as harmonic entropy, spectral centroid, and the irregularity of the partial series significantly influence consonance judgments, often overriding simple integer frequency ratios. Our findings empirically validate that timbre is not a secondary parameter but a fundamental determinant of harmonic perception, necessitating a revision of psychoacoustic models that rely solely on pitch-based roughness and harmonicity.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Quantifying Timbral Influence on Harmonic Consonance Perception through Deep Learning
"This paper presents a hybrid computational model for automated Schenkerian analysis that integrates probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) with recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We formalize the rules of Schenkerian reduction as a grammatical system, where terminal symbols are notes and non-terminal symbols represent middleground prolongational structures (e.g., linear progressions, neighbor notes). A PCFG is first trained on a hand-annotated corpus of Schenkerian graphs to learn the probabilities of various reduction rules. To overcome the PCFG's insensitivity to long-range context, an LSTM-based RNN is employed to re-rank the parse trees generated by the grammar, conditioning the probability of a structural interpretation on the broader melodic and harmonic context. This hybrid approach significantly outperforms purely grammar-based or purely neural models in generating structurally coherent and musically plausible analyses of tonal melodies.

We introduce a novel constraint into the NMF optimization algorithm based on temporal sparsity and harmonicity, which biases the decomposition towards musically meaningful components. This method is capable of identifying motives irrespective of their orchestration or vertical alignment within the texture, effectively capturing instances of thematic development, imitation, and fragmentation.

Simultaneously, we derive structural and expressive features from the corresponding audio recordings, including onset times, dynamic envelopes, and tempo curves. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is then used to establish an optimal alignment between the gestural and acoustic feature streams, accommodating non-linear temporal fluctuations. Cross-correlation analysis on the aligned data reveals strong predictive relationships between preparatory gestures and subsequent dynamic changes, and between the ictus and metric articulation.

For each progression, we synthesize an audio equivalent and compute a vector of psychoacoustic features, including sensory dissonance (roughness), harmonicity, and tonal tension using models by Hutchinson & Knopoff and Parncutt. We then measure the geometric path length of the progression within each theoretical space. A comparative analysis reveals that specific orbifold models exhibit a significantly stronger correlation between geometric distance and psychoacoustic tension/dissonance than traditional spatial models. This suggests that the topological structure of these advanced geometrical spaces implicitly encodes perceptual principles of voice-leading and harmonic stability, providing a powerful theoretical link between abstract mathematical music theory and the perceptual experience of tonality.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Geometrical Tonal Space Models and their Correlation with Audio-Derived Consonance Metrics

This allows for the representation of both strict prohibitions (e.g., parallel fifths) and soft stylistic preferences (e.g., favoring stepwise motion). Unlike constraint-satisfaction systems that produce a single valid solution, our MLN-based generator can sample from the probability distribution defined by the weighted rules, producing a variety of stylistically coherent yet distinct contrapuntal lines against a given cantus firmus. The weights are learned from a corpus of Palestrina's music, ensuring stylistic verisimilitude.

Key acoustic features, such as psychoacoustic roughness (based on the Plomp-Levelt model), harmonic entropy, and the composite spectral centroid, were calculated for each sonority. These objective metrics were then correlated with perceptual ratings of consonance and stability obtained from listening tests. Our findings indicate that while spectral roughness remains a primary predictor of dissonance, harmonic entropy emerges as a crucial factor in differentiating the affective character of microtonal chords that exhibit similar roughness profiles.

A pre-geometric toy model is constructed based on a graph of entangled qubits, whose connectivity is dynamically determined by a Hamiltonian that favors minimal entanglement entropy across any bipartition, an information-theoretic analogue of a minimal surface principle. Using a tensor network representation, we demonstrate that small perturbations to the ground state's entanglement structure manifest as local deformations of the graph geometry. In the continuum limit, the effective dynamics of these deformations are shown to obey a linearized version of the Einstein field equations, where the Ricci tensor is proportional to the local entanglement density. This 'it from qubit' model provides a concrete realization of emergent gravity, where the gravitational field is not a fundamental entity but an effective description of the underlying quantum information geometry, explicitly linking the Ryu-Takayanagi formula to the system's fundamental dynamics.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Fizik,Generated,Spacetime Curvature from Entanglement in a Pre-Geometric Holographic Model
"The merger of binary neutron stars can produce hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) remnants, potent sources of gravitational waves and electromagnetic signals. We present high-resolution general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations that demonstrate extremely rapid magnetic field amplification in the HMNS interior. Differential rotation in the post-merger remnant drives a powerful turbulent dynamo, seeded by the magnetorotational and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. Within 15 milliseconds, the initial seed field (10¹² G) is amplified by over four orders of magnitude, reaching a dynamically significant, saturated state with field strengths exceeding 10¹⁶ G. This process creates a large-scale, ordered poloidal field structure capable of launching a relativistic, Poynting-flux-dominated jet upon the eventual collapse of the HMNS to a black hole. Our results provide a robust mechanism for the central engines of short gamma-ray bursts and suggest that neutron star mergers are a primary formation channel for magnetars.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Fizik,Generated,Turbulent Dynamo and Magnetar-Level Field Amplification in Post-Merger Hypermassive Neutron Stars
"The transition between the ergodic and many-body localized (MBL) phases is a central, unresolved problem in quantum statistical mechanics. We challenge the standard picture of a sharp, energy-resolved mobility edge by investigating the eigenstate properties of a disordered one-dimensional Heisenberg spin chain using large-scale exact diagonalization and a time-dependent variational principle. Our finite-size scaling analysis of the participation entropy and the multifractal spectrum of eigenstates reveals an extended, non-ergodic critical region rather than a sharp transition. The multifractal dimension, Dq, exhibits a continuous, non-trivial dependence on the energy density across the entire MBL crossover, which is inconsistent with a simple ergodic-MBL dichotomy. These results suggest that the transition is governed by quantum Griffiths-like effects, where rare ergodic regions dominate thermalization dynamics, fundamentally altering the critical phenomenology and calling for a revised theoretical framework beyond current models.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Fizik,Generated,Anomalous Multifractality and the Absence of a Sharp Mobility Edge in the Many-Body Localization Transition
"The ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex EP400 plays a pivotal role in transcriptional regulation by catalyzing the exchange of histone H2A.Z for canonical H2A. We present the cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) structure of the human 650 kDa TRRAP-EP400 core subcomplex at 3.1 Å resolution. The structure reveals an intricate dodecameric assembly, where the TRRAP pseudokinase domain forms a central scaffold coordinating multiple EP400 subunits, including the Swi2/Snf2-family ATPase motor and the HSA domain. Our structural analysis identifies a previously uncharacterized actin-related protein module, ARP5-ARP6, which projects from the core and likely mediates nucleosome recognition. Importantly, we observe the ATPase domain in an ADP-bound, pre-hydrolysis state, providing mechanistic insights into the conformational changes that drive histone eviction. Functional assays using structure-guided mutagenesis confirm that disruption of the TRRAP-HSA interface abrogates H2A.Z deposition in vivo.

"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical regulators of gene expression, often acting as molecular scaffolds. Here, we investigate the interaction between the lncRNA MALAT1 and the proto-oncogenic splicing factor SRSF1. Using a combination of chemical crosslinking, mass spectrometry (CLIP-MS), and NMR spectroscopy, we identify a highly conserved stem-loop structure within MALAT1 that functions as a high-affinity binding platform for the RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) of SRSF1. We demonstrate that this interaction sequesters SRSF1 within nuclear speckles, thereby modulating its phosphorylation state and availability for pre-mRNA splicing. Ribo-seq analysis following MALAT1 depletion reveals global shifts in alternative splicing, particularly affecting exons regulated by SRSF1. Our data show that MALAT1 acts as a dynamic repository for SRSF1, titrating its activity to fine-tune the cellular splicing landscape. This reveals a sophisticated mechanism of post-transcriptional control mediated by lncRNA architecture, with profound implications for oncogenesis driven by splicing dysregulation.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Mechanistic Dissection of lncRNA MALAT1-Mediated Regulation of Splicing Factor Serine/Arginine-Rich Splicing Factor 1 (SRSF1)

Its dynamic architecture is critical for activating the ATM kinase and initiating end resection. We employed single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to directly visualize the conformational dynamics of human MRN upon binding to DNA substrates mimicking DSBs. Our results reveal that in its apo state, the Rad50 coiled-coils are highly flexible. Upon ATP binding, Rad50 undergoes a zinc-hook-dependent dimerization, clamping the complex into a rigid, closed conformation. Subsequent engagement with DNA triggers ATP hydrolysis and a large-scale opening of the Rad50 arms, a state stabilized by the C-terminus of Nbs1. This open conformation is essential for the processive 3'-5' exonuclease activity of Mre11. These findings provide a real-time, molecular-level movie of the MRN catalytic cycle, linking ATP-driven conformational switching to the sequential steps of DSB processing and signaling.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Single-Molecule FRET Reveals Conformational Dynamics of the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 Complex During DNA Double-Strand Break Resection
"Programmable epigenetic editing offers a powerful tool for dissecting gene regulatory networks and potential therapeutic applications. Here, we engineered a novel tripartite fusion protein consisting of a nuclease-dead Cas9 (dCas9), a Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, and the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). We demonstrate that targeting this dCas9-KRAB-MeCP2 editor to promoter or enhancer regions induces robust and heritable transcriptional silencing. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) reveals that the editor establishes a stable repressive chromatin state, characterized by the deposition of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 marks, DNA methylation, and recruitment of heterochromatin protein 1α (HP1α). Unlike transient repression by dCas9-KRAB, this silencing persists through multiple cell divisions even after cessation of editor expression. Applying this system to key developmental transcription factors, we achieved directed differentiation of embryonic stem cells, highlighting its utility for precise, long-term manipulation of cellular identity through engineered heterochromatin domains.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Targeted Epigenetic Silencing via dCas9-KRAB-MeCP2 Fusion Induces Stable Heterochromatin Formation and Lineage-Specific Gene Repression
"Transcription factors often function within biomolecular condensates formed through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), but the link between phase separation and cell-type-specific gene expression remains unclear. We show that the B-cell master regulator PAX5 undergoes LLPS in vitro and in vivo. The process is driven by multivalent interactions mediated by its intrinsically disordered regions and is regulated by phosphorylation. Using super-resolution microscopy, we observed PAX5 condensates colocalizing with RNA Polymerase II and BRD4 at super-enhancers critical for B-cell identity. Perturbing PAX5 phase separation through mutagenesis of key residues in its disordered domains disrupts condensate formation, diminishes super-enhancer activity, and leads to a loss of B-cell-specific gene expression and aberrant differentiation. Our results indicate that PAX5-mediated LLPS functions as a physical mechanism to concentrate the transcriptional machinery at key regulatory loci, thereby establishing and maintaining a robust cell-type-specific gene expression program.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Phase Separation of the Transcription Factor PAX5 Organizes B-Cell Identity by Forming Condensates at Super-Enhancers
"The epitranscriptomic mark N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is primarily known for its roles in post-transcriptional RNA fate. We uncovered a novel function for m6A in co-transcriptional gene regulation. Using native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq) combined with m6A mapping, we found that m6A is deposited on nascent pre-mRNAs near polyadenylation sites. We demonstrate that the m6A reader protein YTHDC1 directly interacts with the Integrator complex, a key factor in the termination of non-coding RNA transcription. Depletion of the m6A methyltransferase METTL3 or YTHDC1 resulted in widespread transcriptional read-through at protein-coding genes and premature termination at long non-coding RNA loci. Our findings reveal that co-transcriptional m6A deposition serves as a molecular beacon for YTHDC1-mediated recruitment of the Integrator complex, which facilitates efficient transcription termination and 3'-end processing. This work establishes a direct link between RNA modification and the core transcriptional machinery, adding a new layer of regulatory complexity.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,N6-methyladenosine (m6A) on Nascent Transcripts Recruits the Integrator Complex to Regulate Transcriptional Termination
"Mitochondrial quality control is essential for cellular homeostasis, with mitophagy being a primary clearance pathway for damaged mitochondria. While the PINK1/Parkin pathway is a major mitophagy driver, alternative mechanisms exist. We identified the F-box protein FBXL17 as a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase that orchestrates PINK1-independent mitophagy. Upon mitochondrial depolarization, FBXL17 is recruited to the outer mitochondrial membrane via a direct, phosphorylation-independent interaction with the receptor TOM70. FBXL17 then mediates K63-linked ubiquitination of mitochondrial surface proteins, creating a scaffold for autophagy receptors such as NDP52 and Optineurin, thereby tagging the entire organelle for lysosomal degradation. Depletion of FBXL17 impairs clearance of damaged mitochondria in Parkin-deficient cells and sensitizes them to stress. This study elucidates a parallel mitophagy pathway that complements the canonical PINK1/Parkin system, providing new insights into the robustness and versatility of mitochondrial quality control mechanisms.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,"A Novel Ubiquitin Ligase, FBXL17, Mediates PINK1-Independent Mitophagy through Direct Recognition of TOM70"
"The integrated stress response (ISR) enables cells to adapt to proteotoxic stress by globally repressing protein synthesis while selectively translating stress-related mRNAs. The molecular determinants of this selectivity are incompletely understood. We performed simultaneous ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) and quantitative mass spectrometry on cells undergoing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Our integrated analysis revealed hundreds of mRNAs that escape global translational repression. We demonstrate that this escape is predominantly mediated by upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the 5' untranslated regions. Under stress, phosphorylated eIF2α levels increase, promoting ribosome bypass of inhibitory uORFs and re-initiation at the main coding sequence. Using CRISPR-mediated uORF mutagenesis, we validate this mechanism for key ISR effectors like ATF4 and GADD34. Our genome-wide data provide a comprehensive catalog of uORF-mediated translational control and establish a general principle for how cells reprogram their translatome to mount an effective stress response.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Integrative Ribosome Profiling and Proteomics Reveal Widespread Translational Control by uORFs During Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress
"Telomere integrity is maintained by telomerase, a reverse transcriptase that extends the G-rich 3' overhang. While G-quadruplexes (G4s) on the G-rich strand are known telomerase inhibitors, the role of secondary structures on the complementary C-rich strand remains obscure. Here, we demonstrate using NMR spectroscopy and circular dichroism that the human telomeric C-rich strand folds into intramolecular i-motif structures under physiologically relevant acidic pH conditions, such as those found in the tumor microenvironment. Using a reconstituted in vitro telomerase extension assay, we show that i-motif formation on the template strand potently inhibits telomerase processivity. We further identify the helicase DHX36 as a specific i-motif resolvase that promotes telomerase function. Depletion of DHX36 in cancer cells leads to telomere shortening and sensitizes them to G4-stabilizing agents. Our findings reveal the i-motif as a new regulatory element in telomere biology, creating a dynamic structural equilibrium that fine-tunes telomerase access and activity.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,G-Quadruplex Structures in Telomeric C-Rich Strands Form i-Motifs that Regulate Telomerase Activity
"The maturation of Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand requires the coordinated action of several enzymes to produce an intact DNA duplex.

The structure captures LIG1 in a catalytically competent state, encircling the DNA nick. The PCNA-interacting peptide (PIP) box of LIG1 anchors it to the front face of the PCNA ring, while a secondary non-canonical interaction site provides topological stability. This dual interaction orients the LIG1 catalytic core optimally over the nick.

"Cryptic speciation challenges our understanding of biodiversity, particularly in marine environments where morphological stasis is common. We investigated the genomic architecture of divergence in the copepod Eurytemora affinis across a brackish water salinity gradient. Using whole-genome resequencing from multiple populations, we identified a pattern of high background gene flow punctuated by discrete genomic islands of exceptional differentiation (high Fst). These islands disproportionately harbor genes related to osmoregulation and ion transport, implicating divergent ecological selection as the primary driver of reproductive isolation. Coalescent modeling supports a scenario of allopatric divergence followed by secondary contact, with evidence for reinforcement in sympatric zones.

Through a comprehensive phylogenomic analysis of 30 deeply-branching microbial eukaryote lineages, we reveal a pattern of pervasive and ancient HGT from both Bacteria and Archaea. Our stringent pipeline, controlling for contamination and phylogenetic artifacts, identified thousands of high-confidence xenologous gene families integrated into host genomes. These acquired genes are non-randomly distributed, showing significant enrichment for metabolic functions, particularly anaerobic respiration and carbohydrate metabolism, suggesting HGT as a key mechanism for metabolic innovation and niche expansion.

Integrating geometric morphometrics with comparative transcriptomics of developing pharyngeal jaws, we demonstrate that divergence in jaw morphology is tightly correlated with differential expression of key developmental regulatory genes, including bmp4, eda, and members of the Wnt signaling pathway. Phylogenetic comparative methods reveal that the rate of transcriptomic evolution in these specific loci significantly exceeds neutral expectations and predicts the magnitude of morphological disparity.

Our analysis reveals recurrent selective sweeps at plant resistance (R) loci, followed by counter-adaptive sweeps at corresponding avirulence (Avr) effector loci in the pathogen. Crucially, we show that these dynamics maintain high levels of polymorphism at both R and Avr loci across the metapopulation, consistent with the predictions of negative frequency-dependent selection, where rare alleles confer a transient fitness advantage. This coevolutionary chase, governed by reciprocal selection pressures, not only drives rapid molecular evolution but also acts as a potent mechanism for the long-term maintenance of genetic variation underlying disease resistance within natural populations.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Molecular Arms-Race Dynamics and Negative Frequency-Dependent Selection in a Plant-Pathogen System

A genome-wide association study (GWAS) for lifetime reproductive success and longevity identified numerous quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with pleiotropic effects. We found a significant enrichment of loci where alleles conferring higher early-life fecundity were strongly correlated with accelerated late-life mortality and functional decline. These AP loci are disproportionately located in conserved metabolic signaling pathways, such as insulin/IGF-1 and TOR signaling, implicating energy allocation as the core physiological mediator.

We investigated the origin of steroid hormone specificity by resurrecting the ancestral corticoid receptor (AncCR) from before the gene duplication event that gave rise to modern glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors. Using phylogenetic ancestral sequence reconstruction, we synthesized AncCR and characterized its biophysical properties. In contrast to its specialized descendants, AncCR exhibited significant promiscuity, responding potently to both aldosterone and cortisol. Mutational analyses revealed that the evolution of glucocorticoid specificity was contingent upon a small number of key amino acid substitutions that were only effective within the permissive epistatic context of the ancestral protein scaffold. These findings illustrate how historical contingency and intramolecular epistasis constrain evolutionary trajectories, channeling functional divergence along specific, otherwise inaccessible, mutational pathways following gene duplication.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Resurrection and Biophysical Characterization of an Ancestral Glucocorticoid Receptor Reveals Epistatic Constraints on Hormone Specificity

We identified thousands of differentially expressed genes, revealing a profound reprogramming of metabolic, neurogenic, and reproductive pathways between castes from a shared genomic background. Critically, we discovered extensive caste-specific DNA methylation patterns, particularly in promoter regions of key developmental genes and transcription factors. These differentially methylated regions (DMRs) are strongly predictive of gene expression levels, suggesting that epigenetic modifications, rather than genetic sequence, are the primary proximate mechanism for establishing and maintaining caste identity.

"Whole-genome duplication (WGD) is a transformative event providing vast raw material for evolutionary innovation. We analyzed the long-term fate of duplicate genes (ohnologs) stemming from the teleost-specific WGD (3R) event approximately 350 million years ago, using a comparative genomic framework across 15 fish species. Synteny-based analysis revealed that nearly 20% of ohnolog pairs have been retained since the 3R event, a rate far exceeding neutral expectation. By analyzing tissue-specific expression atlases, we demonstrate that the predominant mode of retention is subfunctionalization, with ancestral expression profiles partitioned between the two duplicates. However, a functionally crucial subset of ohnologs, enriched for transcription factors and developmental genes, shows clear evidence of neofunctionalization, with one copy acquiring novel expression domains and accelerated protein sequence evolution.

Using Bayesian model-fitting approaches, we found that for a majority of traits, models of neutral evolution, such as Brownian motion or phylogenetic drift, provided a significantly better fit than adaptive models incorporating selective optima (e.g., Ornstein-Uhlenbeck). Rates of trait evolution were largely decoupled from rates of lineage diversification, contrary to the predictions of adaptive radiation theory.

This rapid evolution in male manipulative proteins is mirrored by accelerated evolution in a corresponding set of female-expressed proteins involved in sperm storage and remating behavior.

Our model incorporates a Lorentzian spectral density, characteristic of a damped harmonic oscillator or a photonic cavity mode. We demonstrate that reservoir memory effects induce significant revivals of quantum coherence and transient entanglement trapping, phenomena absent in standard Markovian treatments.

We measure the participation entropy and the imbalance between even and odd qubit sites as a function of time and disorder strength. For weak disorder, the system rapidly thermalizes, leading to entropy growth and decay of the initial imbalance, consistent with the ergodic hypothesis. Above a critical disorder threshold, we observe a dramatic suppression of transport and a persistent memory of the initial state, characterized by a saturation of the imbalance at a non-zero value and a logarithmic growth of entanglement entropy.

This paper introduces the Proximal Kernel Doubly Robust (PKDR) estimator, a novel semi-parametric method that leverages proxy variables for the latent confounders. The proposed methodology synthesizes proximal causal inference with modern machine learning techniques. We construct nuisance function estimators for the propensity score and outcome models using kernel ridge regression in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, allowing for complex nonlinear relationships. The core of the PKDR estimator is a debiased moment function, constructed via Neyman-orthogonal scores, which ensures double robustness against misspecification of one of the nuisance models. We establish that our estimator is root-n consistent and asymptotically normal under substantially weaker identification conditions than competing methods. Theoretical results demonstrate semi-parametric efficiency bounds are achieved when both nuisance components are correctly specified.

"This paper presents a Bayesian nonparametric framework for inferring community structure in dynamic, multilayer networks. We introduce the Temporal Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Stochastic Block Model (THDP-SBM), which models the evolution of latent communities over time and their dependencies across network layers. The framework posits that each node possesses a vector of latent community memberships, drawn from a shared, time-evolving Indian Buffet Process prior, which encourages temporal persistence in community assignments. Inter-layer dependencies are captured through a coupled prior structure on the block interaction matrices. For scalable posterior inference, we develop a stochastic variational inference algorithm that leverages natural gradient updates and subsampling, enabling analysis of large-scale network data. Our model obviates the need to pre-specify the number of communities and provides a principled means of tracking community births, deaths, and mergers over time.

"Classical functional data analysis (FDA) methods often fail to capture complex topological and geometric features inherent in stochastic processes. We propose Persistent Homology Functional Principal Component Analysis (PH-FPCA), a novel method that integrates topological data analysis (TDA) with FDA. For each functional observation, we compute its persistence diagram, which summarizes multiscale topological features (connected components, loops). These diagrams, residing in a non-Euclidean space, are then mapped into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space using a stable persistence scale-space kernel. We subsequently perform functional principal component analysis in this feature space to extract the dominant modes of topological variation. We establish the theoretical consistency of the estimated topological principal components and demonstrate their utility. The PH-FPCA approach offers superior performance in clustering and classification of complex functional data, such as high-frequency financial time series and electroencephalography (EEG) signals, where traditional amplitude-based FPCA is insufficient.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,Persistent Homology Functional Principal Component Analysis for Topological Feature Extraction in Stochastic Processes

We introduce a highly scalable and accurate approximation method, Structured Kernel Interpolation Variational Inference (SKIVI). Our approach combines the strengths of sparse and structured GP approximations. We use a set of inducing points to create a low-rank approximation, and crucially, we structure these inducing points on a grid, enabling the use of a Kronecker-structured covariance matrix. This structure permits highly efficient computations via the Fast Fourier Transform, reducing the per-iteration complexity of stochastic variational inference from cubic to quasi-linear.

Standard estimation is often biased due to regularization. This paper develops a general framework for constructing debiased and asymptotically normal estimators for such parameters. The methodology employs Neyman-orthogonal moment functions and cross-fitting to mitigate the impact of regularization bias from estimating infinite-dimensional nuisance parameters (e.g., the conditional hazard function). We use flexible machine learning algorithms, like gradient boosting or neural networks, to estimate these nuisance functions, allowing for complex covariate interactions. The resulting estimator is root-n consistent, asymptotically Gaussian, and semi-parametrically efficient under mild sparsity assumptions.

This extends beyond mean, quantile, or functional regression to model the entire conditional distribution as a function of covariates. We formulate the problem within the geometric space of probability measures endowed with the Wasserstein-2 metric. The regression function is defined as a mapping from the covariate space to the Wasserstein space, and the predicted conditional distribution is estimated as the Fréchet mean, or Wasserstein barycenter, of the observed response distributions. We develop a projection-gradient descent algorithm for estimation, leveraging entropic regularization and Sinkhorn iterations for efficient computation of barycenters.

Our approach, termed Differentially Private Debiased Influence Function (DP-DIF), operates by injecting calibrated Gaussian noise into the empirical influence function representation of the M-estimator. A key innovation is a subsequent debiasing step that corrects for the systematic attenuation bias introduced by the privacy mechanism, which is critical for achieving correct frequentist coverage. We derive the asymptotic distribution of our private estimator and provide a formal characterization of the privacy-utility trade-off, quantifying the increase in confidence interval length as a function of the privacy budget \epsilon.

"Standard conformal prediction provides distribution-free, finite-sample uncertainty guarantees but relies critically on the assumption of data exchangeability, which is violated in many settings like time series or clustered data. This paper introduces Conformalized Residual Prediction (CRP), an extension of the conformal framework that provides valid marginal predictive intervals for non-exchangeable data. The key idea is to define a non-conformity score based on the residuals of a conditional predictive model, which accounts for the local dependency structure. For time series, the score is based on one-step-ahead forecast errors from a model conditioned on the recent past. We prove that under mild mixing conditions or for conditionally exchangeable data, the CRP procedure attains valid marginal coverage. This result holds for any underlying predictive algorithm, making it a model-agnostic wrapper for uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate its superior performance over naive conformal methods in time series forecasting and longitudinal data analysis, yielding tighter and more reliable prediction intervals.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,Conformalized Residual Prediction: Achieving Finite-Sample Predictive Coverage with Dependent Data

The BCF model places a prior distribution over the ensemble of trees, encompassing the splitting rules, tree depth, and leaf-node parameters, building upon the Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) framework. Posterior inference is performed via a tailored Particle Gibbs algorithm that efficiently explores the vast model space. The resulting posterior distribution over the CATE function naturally yields pointwise credible intervals and allows for formal inference on covariate interactions. We establish posterior contraction rates for the CATE estimator under smoothness and sparsity assumptions and show through simulation that BCF provides more reliable coverage and honest uncertainty estimates than existing methods.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,Bayesian Causal Forests for Credible Inference of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects

Our method models the data tensor with a low-rank CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition within a probabilistic framework that naturally imputes missing entries. To enhance interpretability and incorporate domain knowledge, we introduce structured penalties on the latent factor matrices. For instance, a fused LASSO penalty on the temporal factor encourages piecewise constant patterns, while an L1 penalty on the modality factor induces sparsity. We derive a scalable variational expectation-maximization algorithm for posterior inference. We provide theoretical guarantees on the recovery of the underlying tensor under noisy and incomplete observations. The utility of PPTF is showcased by its application to a multi-modal neuroimaging study, where it effectively identifies shared and subject-specific trajectories of brain activity.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,Penalized Probabilistic Tensor Factorization for Analyzing Incomplete Multi-way Longitudinal Data

Our analysis focuses on the quantum error-correcting properties inherent in this holographic mapping. We show that logical operators corresponding to bulk observables can be represented by multiple, distinct physical operators on the boundary, a feature known as subregion duality. This operator redundancy provides a concrete realization of bulk locality and its protection from local boundary perturbations.

By adiabatically transporting these quasiholes, we simulate braiding operations and compute the resulting Berry matrices, which form a unitary representation of the braid group. Our results explicitly confirm that the braiding statistics are consistent with the Fibonacci model, where the fusion rules and braid matrices satisfy the relations required for universal topological quantum computation. We further analyze the primary decoherence channels, including quasiparticle mislocalization and diabatic transitions to excited states, by introducing localized perturbations.

By calculating the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC), we extract the quantum Lyapunov exponent, which characterizes the exponential growth of operators in the semi-classical limit. Our analysis reveals that while strong disorder can suppress the scrambling rate, the system remains maximally chaotic up to a critical disorder strength. We connect these findings to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) by examining the statistical properties of matrix elements of local operators in the energy eigenbasis. We find that the onset of chaos, as indicated by the OTOC, coincides with the emergence of ETH-compliant behavior. Furthermore, we discuss the gravitational dual, linking the Lyapunov exponent to the pole-skipping phenomenon in the shockwave geometry near the black hole horizon, thus reinforcing the holographic correspondence for chaotic quantum systems.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Kuantum,Generated,Information Scrambling and Eigenstate Thermalization in a Disordered SYK-type Model

In the MBL phase, we confirm the characteristic logarithmic growth of bipartite entanglement entropy following a quantum quench, a direct consequence of emergent local integrals of motion (l-bits). Approaching the transition from the localized side, we observe a sharp increase in entanglement growth and fluctuations. Our finite-size scaling analysis suggests the transition is governed by an avalanche mechanism, where thermalizing 'bubbles' locally seeded by rare non-local resonances catalytically thermalize adjacent regions. This mechanism implies that the MBL phase is unstable in dimensions higher than one and places stringent constraints on the universality class of the MBL-to-ergodic transition, challenging phenomenological real-space renormalization group theories.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Kuantum,Generated,Logarithmic Entanglement Growth and Avalanche Instability at the Many-Body Localization Transition

The drive and dissipation of the ancilla are engineered to create a non-unitary process that autonomously corrects small displacement errors in the cavity state, effectively confining it to the GKP code subspace. This is achieved by designing a specific unconditional master equation whose steady-state manifold is the desired code space. The scheme obviates the need for explicit syndrome measurements and feedback loops, providing a passive, hardware-level protection against the dominant error channels, including both small shifts in phase space and single-photon loss.

COMARL incorporates a conservative Q-learning objective that penalizes out-of-distribution (OOD) joint actions, thereby regularizing the policy towards behaviors well-supported by the static dataset. To further enrich the data and improve generalization, we train a conditional generative model to perform counterfactual data augmentation, synthesizing plausible joint trajectories that could have occurred under alternative policies. This augmented dataset allows the critic to learn a more robust value function. We evaluate COMARL on challenging cooperative tasks in the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) and show that it significantly outperforms existing offline MARL baselines, learning near-optimal policies from highly suboptimal datasets.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Offline Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Conservative Policy Regularization and Counterfactual Data Augmentation
"We present a neuro-symbolic framework for inductive program synthesis that combines the perceptual strengths of deep learning with the rigorous logic of formal methods. Our approach, Neuro-Symbolic Differentiable Abstract Interpretation (NS-DAI), trains a neural network policy to guide a symbolic search through the space of possible programs. The key innovation is a differentiable abstract interpreter that executes partial programs over abstract domains, yielding continuous, gradient-based feedback on program correctness. This feedback, representing the 'semantic distance' from the target specification, provides a rich training signal that circumvents the sparse rewards of traditional execution-based synthesis. By backpropagating through the abstract interpretation process, the neural policy learns powerful heuristics for pruning the search space. NS-DAI successfully synthesizes complex, recursive algorithms from input-output examples, demonstrating a significant improvement over both purely neural and classic search-based program synthesis techniques.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Inductive Program Synthesis via Differentiable Abstract Interpretation
"Accurate uncertainty quantification is paramount for deploying neural networks in safety-critical domains. We propose a computationally efficient yet theoretically sound method for estimating epistemic uncertainty, termed Conformalized Gradient-based Ensembles (CGE). CGE approximates a posterior distribution over model weights by creating a functional ensemble from a single training trajectory, using checkpoints and gradients to induce diversity. This avoids the prohibitive cost of training deep ensembles. Critically, we apply split conformal prediction techniques to the variance of the ensemble's predictions, producing rigorous uncertainty intervals with guaranteed marginal coverage rates, a property lacking in most Bayesian deep learning methods. CGE yields well-calibrated epistemic uncertainty estimates that are highly effective for out-of-distribution detection and active learning, achieving performance comparable to deep ensembles at a fraction of the computational budget. We demonstrate its utility on medical imaging and autonomous driving perception tasks.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Calibrated Epistemic Uncertainty Quantification using Conformalized Gradient-based Ensembles
"Self-supervised learning for video has largely focused on learning representations that are invariant to transformations. However, for understanding dynamic scenes, equivariance to spatio-temporal transformations (e.g., rotation, time-reversal) is more desirable. We introduce Spatio-Temporal Equivariant Contrastive Learning (STECL), a novel framework that learns representations that transform predictably under the action of a defined group of transformations. We formulate a contrastive objective in a latent space where augmentations correspond to group actions. The model is trained to minimize the distance between a transformed input's representation and the group-transformed representation of the original input. This forces the model to encode the intrinsic structure of the dynamics rather than just appearance. STECL learns powerful motion semantics, achieving state-of-the-art performance on downstream tasks like action recognition and video retrieval, particularly in low-data regimes, without relying on any semantic labels.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Spatio-Temporal Equivariant Contrastive Learning for Video Representation
"Meta-learning algorithms often produce point estimates of task-specific parameters, failing to capture uncertainty and leading to overconfidence in few-shot settings. We propose Hypernetwork-Amortized Variational Inference (HAVI), a scalable Bayesian meta-learning framework. Instead of learning a prior distribution over model parameters directly, we train a hypernetwork that maps a task's support set to the parameters of an approximate posterior distribution over the task-specific model's weights. This amortizes the cost of variational inference, allowing for efficient, feed-forward generation of a posterior for any new task. By marginalizing over this predicted posterior during inference, our method provides robust predictions and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. HAVI effectively mitigates the problem of meta-overfitting to the training task distribution and demonstrates superior accuracy and uncertainty calibration on challenging, cross-domain few-shot classification and regression benchmarks compared to existing probabilistic and deterministic meta-learning methods.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Bayesian Meta-Learning with Hypernetwork-Amortized Variational Inference
"Intragenomic conflict is a potent evolutionary force, exemplified by meiotic drive systems where selfish genetic elements subvert Mendelian segregation. We investigate the coevolutionary dynamics between the segregation distorter (SD) locus in *Drosophila melanogaster* and the repetitive satellite DNA at its target, Responder (Rsp). Using high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) and population genomic analyses, we demonstrate that SD-induced chromatin condensation is modulated by the copy number and sequence composition of Rsp satellite arrays. We find that rapid, non-reciprocal expansion and contraction of these arrays create a dynamic fitness landscape, allowing host genomes to escape the deleterious effects of drive. Our results indicate a recurrent arms race, where centromeric satellite DNA evolution is not a neutral process but is instead driven by intense selection to suppress segregation distortion. This provides a mechanistic link between selfish gene evolution, heterochromatin dynamics, and the rapid evolution of genomic architecture, potentially contributing to postzygotic reproductive isolation.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Meiotic Drive and the Evolutionary Dynamics of Satellite DNA Expansion in Drosophila
"The genetic legacy of archaic hominins in modern human populations provides a unique window into past adaptations. We present a comprehensive analysis of a novel introgressed haplotype of Denisovan origin, found at high frequency in Tibetan and Himalayan populations, which contains a paralog of the Endothelial PAS domain-containing protein 1 (EPAS1) gene, designated *EPAS1B*. Through functional genomics assays using CRISPR-Cas9 engineered cell lines and analysis of paleoproteomic data, we demonstrate that this archaic allele confers a distinct transcriptional response to hypoxic stress, dampening the erythropoietic feedback loop and preventing polycythemia. Coalescent simulations and scans for positive selection confirm the haplotype's Denisovan origin and subsequent selective sweep in ancestral high-altitude populations post-introgression. This discovery elucidates a clear case of adaptive introgression providing a complex physiological solution to a severe environmental challenge, underscoring the importance of admixture as a source of evolutionary innovation in human history.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Adaptive Introgression of an Archaic Denisovan Haplotype Confers High-Altitude Hypoxia Tolerance
"The role of phenotypic plasticity in facilitating large-scale evolutionary diversification remains a central, unresolved question. We examined this phenomenon within the explosive adaptive radiation of African cichlid fishes, focusing on the development of their highly labile pharyngeal jaw apparatus. By integrating geometric morphometrics, transcriptomics, and diet-manipulation experiments across a robust phylogenomic framework, we demonstrate that ancestral plasticity in bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and calmodulin signaling pathways precedes, and predicts, the primary axes of morphological diversification. Our phylogenetic comparative methods reveal that lineages occupying novel ecological niches exhibit a marked reduction in plasticity (canalization) following genetic assimilation of environmentally induced phenotypes. These findings provide strong evidence for the 'plasticity-first' hypothesis, where developmental plasticity acts not as a passive buffer, but as an active evolutionary engine that explores functional morphospace, thereby catalyzing rapid and repeated adaptive radiation in complex ecosystems.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Phenotypic Plasticity as a Catalyst for Adaptive Radiation: A Phylogenetic Comparative Analysis of Cichlid Jaw Morphogenesis
"Host-parasite coevolution is often characterized by reciprocal, negative frequency-dependent selection, known as the Red Queen hypothesis. We tracked this dynamic at the molecular level in real-time using an experimental coevolution study between *Arabidopsis thaliana* and the oomycete pathogen *Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis*. By sequencing host and pathogen populations from time-shifted inoculations over 50 generations, we identified cyclical selective sweeps targeting plant nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) resistance genes and corresponding pathogen avirulence (Avr) effectors. We observed a consistent pattern of costly resistance alleles rising in frequency, followed by the emergence and sweep of pathogen effector variants that evade recognition. This process results in a high genetic load and perpetual genomic turnover at coevolving loci, without a net increase in host resistance over time. Our results provide direct genomic evidence for an antagonistic coevolutionary arms race, validating a foundational model of biodiversity maintenance and disease evolution.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Molecular Signatures of a Red Queen Dynamic in a Plant-Pathogen System Revealed by Time-Shifted Experimental Evolution
"The precise phylogenetic relationships among early-branching metazoan phyla remain one of evolution's most persistent challenges. Systematic errors, such as long-branch attraction (LBA) and incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), have produced conflicting topologies from phylogenomic datasets. Here, we re-evaluate the placement of Ctenophora, Porifera, and Placozoa by applying a novel analytical pipeline to a curated dataset of over 1,500 single-copy orthologs from 120 species. Our approach integrates site-heterogeneous mixture models within a supermatrix framework and multi-species coalescent methods that explicitly model ILS. While coalescent analyses marginally favor a Ctenophora-sister topology, model adequacy tests reveal significant conflict among gene trees, particularly in deep internodes. We find that removing fast-evolving gene partitions, a common strategy to reduce LBA, paradoxically exacerbates discordance. Our results suggest that a simple bifurcating tree may be an inadequate model for the explosive radiation of early animal life, highlighting the profound impact of methodological choices and underlying biological complexity in deep phylogenomics.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Resolving the Metazoan Tree of Life: A Phylogenomic Approach Integrating Supermatrix and Coalescent Methods to Mitigate Systematic Error
"Major evolutionary transitions, such as the origin of multicellularity, require the innovation of novel gene functions for processes like cell adhesion, communication, and differentiation. Using the volvocine green algae, a model system spanning from unicellular *Chlamydomonas* to multicellular *Volvox*, we traced the evolutionary fate of gene duplicates preceding the evolution of organismal complexity. Our comparative genomic and transcriptomic analysis reveals that tandem duplications of genes encoding extracellular matrix (ECM) components and cell-cycle regulators were rampant at the base of the multicellular volvocines. Functional characterization via CRISPR-mediated knockouts demonstrates that while one paralog typically retains the ancestral function (subfunctionalization), the other often acquires novel expression domains and functions related to germ-soma differentiation (neofunctionalization). Specifically, the neofunctionalization of a duplicated cyclin-dependent kinase, *regA*, was critical for the evolution of somatic cell terminal differentiation. This provides a clear genetic roadmap where gene duplication serves as a primary engine for generating the raw material for evolutionary innovation.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,The Role of Neofunctionalized Gene Duplicates in the Transition to Multicellularity in Volvocine Algae
"The evolution of complex traits often requires the fixation of multiple mutations, some of which may be individually deleterious, necessitating the crossing of a fitness valley on the adaptive landscape. We developed a series of multi-locus, forward-time population genetics models to investigate the mechanisms facilitating such transitions. Our simulations demonstrate that while stochastic tunneling—the near-simultaneous establishment of multiple mutations—is effective in large populations with high mutation rates, it is insufficient for traversing deep or wide valleys. We introduce the concept of 'epistatic scaffolding', where transient, compensatory mutations create a temporary ridge across the fitness valley, which is later dismantled once the primary adaptive combination is fixed. This mechanism dramatically increases the probability of complex adaptation in smaller, asexual populations. The model reconciles observed rates of multi-drug resistance evolution with theoretical constraints, highlighting the critical role of higher-order epistatic interactions in shaping evolutionary trajectories.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Navigating Fitness Valleys: The Interplay of Stochastic Tunneling and Epistatic Scaffolding in the Evolution of Complex Adaptations
"Post-copulatory sexual selection, driven by sperm competition and cryptic female choice, is a major force in the evolution of reproductive traits. We investigated the coevolutionary interplay between male seminal fluid proteins (SFPs) and female reproductive tract (FRT) morphology in a clade of promiscuous seed beetles (*Callosobruchus*). Using RNA-seq and micro-CT scanning across a well-resolved phylogeny, we found a strong, phylogenetically-corrected correlation between the evolutionary rate of specific SFP families and the complexity of the female spermathecal duct. Functional assays using RNA interference to knock down rapidly evolving SFPs resulted in reduced sperm storage in females with complex FRT morphology, but not in females with simple tracts. These results suggest a lock-and-key coevolutionary dynamic, where female morphology evolves to create hurdles for sperm transport and storage, thereby biasing paternity, while males evolve novel SFPs to overcome these barriers. This provides a clear mechanism for sexually antagonistic coevolution driving rapid diversification of reproductive genes and morphologies.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Cryptic Female Choice and the Coevolution of Seminal Fluid Proteins and Female Reproductive Tract Morphology
"The predictability of evolution is limited by the interplay between determinism, driven by natural selection, and contingency, arising from stochastic historical events. We leveraged the >75,000-generation *E. coli* long-term evolution experiment (LTEE) to dissect these forces. By re-evolving populations from different ancestral timepoints under identical selective pressures, we quantified the impact of historical mutations on subsequent adaptive pathways. We found that early, large-effect mutations in global regulators, such as *spoT*, constrained future evolution by creating epistatic dependencies that precluded alternative, and potentially more optimal, adaptive solutions from arising. In contrast, populations lacking these early mutations explored a wider diversity of adaptive pathways. These findings demonstrate that historical contingency, mediated by epistatic pleiotropy, can channel evolution down specific, non-optimal trajectories. The adaptive landscape is therefore not static but is dynamically reshaped by the very process of evolution, profoundly limiting predictability over long evolutionary timescales.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Contingency and Historical Constraint Shape Adaptive Trajectories in a Long-Term E. coli Evolution Experiment
"Mass extinctions are hypothesized to be potent catalysts of adaptive radiation by creating ecological opportunity. We tested this by analyzing the macroevolutionary dynamics of early Paleocene mammals using a comprehensive fossil dataset and a time-calibrated molecular phylogeny. By applying Bayesian birth-death models and disparity-through-time analyses, we uncovered a striking decoupling of diversification rates. Lineage diversification (speciation rates) peaked immediately following the K-Pg boundary, consistent with the rapid filling of vacant ecospace. However, the rate of morphological innovation (disparity) in key functional traits, particularly dental and tarsal morphology, remained low for the first 5 million years of the Paleocene before accelerating dramatically. This temporal lag suggests that an initial phase of taxonomic diversification into broadly similar niches was followed by a subsequent, more prolonged phase of ecological specialization and morphological innovation. Our results challenge the classic model of explosive, simultaneous radiation and highlight the complex, multi-stage processes governing recovery from mass extinction events.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Decoupled Rates of Morphological and Lineage Diversification Following the Cretaceous-Paleogene Mass Extinction
"This paper investigates the extremal number for specific families of r-uniform hypergraphs derived from iterated expansions. We define the k-th expansion H^(k) of a seed hypergraph H as the hypergraph obtained by iteratively replacing each vertex with a disjoint copy of H. We determine the precise Turán density π(F) for F=K_4^(3)(2), the second expansion of the complete 3-uniform hypergraph on 4 vertices. Our proof employs the hypergraph stability method of Pikhurko and Razborov, combined with a novel spectral delocalization argument to handle the complex intersection patterns inherent in H^(k). We establish that any F-free hypergraph on n vertices must be asymptotically contained within a Turán-type construction based on a specific equitable vertex partition.

Focusing on the case where G is a complete bipartite graph K_{s,t} and H is a disconnected graph, specifically a forest of stars, we significantly improve upon existing exponential bounds. Our main tool is a refined application of the dependent random choice lemma, tailored for the bipartite setting, which allows for the embedding of sparse structures in dense subgraphs with strong neighborhood properties. For H being a matching of size m, we prove BR(K_{s,t}, M_m) ≤ (t+m)^{s+o(1)}, a polynomial bound in m for fixed s and t.

This formulation is manifestly positive and q-monotonic, confirming a long-standing conjecture in this case. The proof involves developing an algebraic framework connecting the Hecke algebra of type C̃_n to an algebra of quasi-symmetric functions equipped with a specialized coproduct. We demonstrate that this construction provides a characterization of the equivariant cohomology of certain Schubert varieties in the affine flag manifold, thereby bridging a gap between algebraic combinatorics and geometric representation theory.

The proof integrates the hypergraph container method with a delicate second-moment argument, requiring precise control over the distribution of small subgraphs near the threshold probability. This result is then leveraged to establish new bounds on the 0-statement for asymmetric Ramsey properties of random hypergraphs. Specifically, we find a new range of edge probabilities p(n) for which G_k(n, p) arrow (F_1, F_2) with high probability, resolving a question posed by Kohayakawa et al. and demonstrating the deep connection between saturation phenomena and thresholds for Ramsey-type properties in random discrete structures.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Matematik,Generated,Threshold Saturation and Asymmetric Ramsey Properties in Sparse Random Hypergraphs

A key innovation is the use of weighted path decompositions in Cayley graphs to construct the initial base designs, which circumvents limitations of previous multiplicative group approaches. This work completes the existence spectrum for λ=1, k=4, and g > g_0 for some effective constant g_0, leaving only a finite, albeit large, number of parameter sets for computational verification.

We construct an infinite family of 3-connected cographic matroids, each possessing multiple projectively inequivalent GF(q)-representations for any prime power q ≥ 3. The construction hinges on a novel connection between gain graphs associated with Dowling geometries and the structure of specific frame matroid minors. By identifying a forbidden minor configuration for unique representability, we prove that for any q ≥ 3, there exists a cographic matroid M such that the number of distinct representations grows with the size of the underlying graph.

The proof circumvents the lack of a traditional additive group structure by developing a theory of 'higher-order Fourier analysis' adapted to the formal group law associated with K(n). This involves defining Gowers-type uniformity norms that respect the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence filtration, providing a bridge between stable homotopy theory and modern additive combinatorics.

Our primary result proves that for any graph G, its DP-chromatic number χ_DP(G) is equal to the maximum DP-chromatic number over all its possible orientations, max_{D ∈ Orient(G)} χ_DP(D). This resolves a conjecture of Bernshteyn and provides a powerful new tool for analyzing graph choosability. As a corollary, we show that this equivalence implies a directed version of the list-coloring conjecture for planar graphs, stating that every strong orientation of a planar graph has a directed 5-list-coloring.

CGCN aims to learn the underlying causal generative process by variationally inferring a latent causal graph G* that is invariant to interventions. The model is trained via a bilevel objective that combines a supervised link prediction loss with a causal regularizer derived from do-calculus. This regularizer encourages the learned representations to be robust to simulated interventions on the graph structure.

AdaDP-FL employs a server-side hyper-variational autoencoder to model the distribution of client model updates. During aggregation, the server allocates a tighter privacy budget (i.e., adds less noise) to clients whose updates are deemed more informative—identified as those lying in low-density regions of the latent distribution—while rigorously maintaining a global (ε, δ)-DP guarantee. This heterogeneity-aware noise injection is coupled with a personalized learning objective to further enhance model utility.

LIFT incorporates a differentiable logic tensor network that operates directly on the semantic embeddings of the LLM. This module evaluates the logical consistency of generated text against a knowledge base of first-order logic constraints, producing a continuous-valued satisfaction score. This score is then used as a regularization term in the fine-tuning objective, allowing for end-to-end training that jointly maximizes task performance and logical coherence. By penalizing logical fallacies in the latent space, LIFT teaches the model to adhere to symbolic rules without sacrificing its generative capabilities.

By minimizing the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance, our method seeks a feature transformation that renders the metric space of target samples isometric to that of the source samples. We introduce a computationally efficient, entropy-regularized GW discrepancy term, solvable via the Sinkhorn algorithm, and integrate it into a deep adversarial learning pipeline. This structural alignment objective encourages the model to preserve crucial topological and geometric properties of the data manifold across domains.

However, their direct application to data with inherent non-Euclidean geometry is philosophically and practically flawed. We present Geodesic Contrastive Learning (GeoCL), a principled framework for representation learning on Riemannian manifolds. GeoCL makes two fundamental contributions: (1) it replaces the standard cosine similarity in the InfoNCE loss with a principled score based on the geodesic distance on the manifold, accurately reflecting the intrinsic geometry; and (2) it defines data augmentations as random walks in the tangent space at each data point, which are then projected back onto the manifold via the exponential map.

"The Nash equilibrium concept, a cornerstone of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), can be computationally intractable and behaviorally restrictive. We argue that the correlated equilibrium (CE) offers a more general and often more efficient solution concept. We propose Correlated Equilibrium Fictitious Co-Play (CE-FCP), a novel MARL algorithm that converges to a CE in general-sum stochastic games. Our method operates within a centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) framework. A centralized critic, leveraging techniques from regret matching and fictitious play, learns a distribution over joint policies that constitutes a coarse correlated equilibrium. Decentralized actors are then trained to follow this correlated strategy. By explicitly learning the correlation device, CE-FCP enables sophisticated multi-agent coordination beyond the scope of independent learners. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees in specific game classes and show empirically that CE-FCP achieves superior or more stable team performance compared to state-of-the-art MARL algorithms in complex coordination and mixed-motive environments.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Learning Correlated Equilibria in General-Sum Markov Games via Fictitious Co-Play
"This paper addresses the problem of constructing confidence intervals and hypothesis tests for individual parameters in high-dimensional graphical models under non-Gaussian assumptions. We extend the debiased Lasso framework to settings where the data are drawn from sub-exponential or other heavy-tailed distributions. The core of our methodology is the construction of a consistent estimator for the inverse precision matrix using a carefully regularized node-wise regression procedure, followed by a bias correction term. We establish non-asymptotic error bounds and prove that the resulting debiased estimator is asymptotically normal under significantly weaker distributional assumptions than previously required. Our theoretical analysis leverages modern concentration inequalities for sums of random variables without finite exponential moments. Extensive simulation studies confirm that our method maintains nominal coverage probabilities in challenging heavy-tailed scenarios where existing methods fail.

To address this, we propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian nonparametric model based on the Pitman-Yor Process (PYP). Our model uses a PYP prior over document-specific topic distributions, which are themselves drawn from a global PYP, effectively capturing the characteristic heavy-tailed distribution of word frequencies. The primary contribution is a scalable inference algorithm based on Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI), which enables the model's application to massive text datasets. We derive the evidence lower bound (ELBO) for our hierarchical PYP model and develop efficient, closed-form updates for the variational parameters.

The proposed method synthesizes inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and g-computation within a unified estimating equation framework, leveraging semiparametric theory. The estimator is doubly robust, remaining consistent if either the model for treatment assignment or the model for the outcome conditional on treatment and confounder history is correctly specified, but not necessarily both. We rigorously establish the asymptotic properties of the estimator, proving its consistency and asymptotic normality, and derive a consistent estimator for its variance. The finite-sample performance is evaluated through extensive Monte Carlo simulations, which demonstrate significant bias reduction and efficiency gains over singly robust methods, particularly under moderate to severe model misspecification.

Our proposed method, Manifold FPCA (MFPCA), defines principal geodesics by minimizing a Fréchet-type variance on the manifold, which serves as a natural generalization of variance. We develop an iterative algorithm based on principal geodesic analysis and kernel smoothing to estimate these components and their associated scores. We establish the consistency of our estimators under suitable regularity conditions on the manifold and the stochastic process.

This hierarchical structure robustly captures complex, spatially-varying dependence patterns that are prevalent in environmental and climate science. We develop a scalable Bayesian inference scheme using a combination of the Kalman filter for the temporal dynamics and a variational inference algorithm for the spatial parameters, avoiding costly MCMC.

Our primary contribution is a novel two-step procedure: an initial robust estimate of the scale parameter is obtained using a median-of-means approach, which then informs the optimal tuning of the Huber loss function for the full dataset. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, establishing non-asymptotic oracle inequalities for the proposed estimator that nearly match the minimax optimal rates for sub-Gaussian errors, but under much weaker moment conditions on the noise.

Our method leverages the natural geometry of the parameter space by defining the Langevin diffusion on the manifold and discretizing it using a retraction operator. Crucially, it employs stochastic gradients, making it suitable for large-scale datasets. We provide a rigorous non-asymptotic analysis of the algorithm's convergence, quantifying the error in terms of Wasserstein distance from the target posterior distribution, accounting for both discretization and stochastic gradient noise.

By applying this calculus to the cluster hypergraph obtained from a regularity partition, we establish that any B(C4)-free 3-uniform hypergraph on n vertices with a near-extremal number of edges must be structurally close to a complete tripartite hypergraph. A subsequent absorption argument allows us to handle imperfections, ultimately proving that for sufficiently large n, ex(n, B(C4)) = |T3(n)|, where T3(n) is the number of edges in the n-vertex 3-partite Turan hypergraph.

Our analysis revealed several genomic regions with significant excess ancestry from the warm-adapted parental species, which have introgressed deep into the range of the cold-adapted species. These regions contain genes associated with thermoregulatory performance, metabolic efficiency, and photoperiodic responses (e.g., AvBD-7, CLOCK). The allelic frequencies at these introgressed loci show strong correlations with longitudinal climate variables, suggesting they are under positive selection. This study provides a clear genomic signature of adaptive introgression as a key mechanism enabling a species to rapidly respond to anthropogenic climate change, highlighting the creative evolutionary potential of hybridization.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Adaptive Introgression of Climate-Associated Loci in a Migratory Avian Hybrid Zone
"Phenotypic evolution is not unconstrained; it is channeled by the underlying architecture of development. We quantified this principle by analyzing the morphospace occupation and evolvability of the tetrapod limb. Using high-resolution 3D geometric morphometrics on a dataset of 350 vertebrate species and integrating it with comparative transcriptomics of limb development, we identified conserved gene regulatory networks (GRNs) involving key transcription factors like Shh, HoxD, and Fgf8. Our results show that observed morphological variation occupies only a small, highly structured subspace of the theoretically possible morphospace. Evolutionary simulations constrained by the empirical GRN topology accurately recapitulate this pattern, whereas unconstrained models do not. These findings indicate that pleiotropic interactions and epistatic buffering within these core developmental GRNs create deep evolutionary furrows, canalizing phenotypic outcomes. This inherent bias in the production of variation explains parallel evolution patterns and the limited disparity of limb morphology across vast evolutionary timescales.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Developmental Constraints and the Canalization of Morphological Evolution in the Vertebrate Limb
"The relative contributions of climate change and anthropogenic pressure to late Pleistocene megafauna extinctions remain intensely debated. We address this using paleogenomic approaches on a time-series of 75 woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) specimens spanning the last 50,000 years. By analyzing low-coverage whole-genome data, we reconstructed demographic histories using pairwise sequentially Markovian coalescent (PSMC) modeling. Our results reveal a long-term decline in effective population size (Ne) initiated long before human arrival, correlating with interglacial warming periods. However, the terminal decline was uniquely characterized by a rapid increase in runs of homozygosity (ROH) and an accumulation of deleterious mutations, hallmarks of a sudden population crash. This genomic evidence of severe inbreeding coincides precisely with the expansion of Clovis paleo-human populations in North America. We conclude that while climate change created long-term vulnerability, anthropogenic pressure was the proximate driver that delivered the final coup de grâce to this iconic species.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Paleogenomic Reconstruction of Pleistocene Megafauna Demography Reveals Extinction Dynamics
"Eusociality represents a major evolutionary transition, yet its molecular underpinnings remain elusive. To identify common genomic architecture associated with this complex social structure, we performed a comprehensive comparative genomic analysis across 20 independently evolved eusocial and 15 solitary Hymenopteran lineages. Following rigorous orthology inference and gene family evolution modeling, we identified statistically significant signatures of convergence. Specifically, eusocial lineages consistently exhibit accelerated evolution and expansion of gene families related to chemosensation (olfactory and gustatory receptors), metabolism (cytochrome P450s), and conserved venom proteins, while showing contraction in certain immune-related gene families. Furthermore, promoter regions of genes involved in caste differentiation, such as vitellogenin and juvenile hormone pathways, show convergent patterns of regulatory element evolution. This multi-layered genomic convergence suggests that a predictable suite of molecular toolkits is repeatedly co-opted to facilitate the evolution of reproductive division of labor and complex social integration.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Convergent Genomic Signatures in the Evolution of Eusociality Across Hymenoptera
"The neutral theory of molecular evolution often assumes a uniform and random mutation process. We challenge this assumption by analyzing whole-genome de novo mutations from multi-generational pedigrees of Mus musculus. Our high-fidelity sequencing approach identified thousands of spontaneous germline mutations, revealing significant local sequence context dependencies and regional heterogeneity in mutational spectra. We found that CpG sites in transcriptionally active regions exhibit a mutation rate an order of magnitude higher than the genome-wide average, driven by methylation-associated deamination. Furthermore, we observed a strong correlation between replication timing and the ratio of G:C to A:T substitutions, indicating a systematic bias linked to the cell cycle. When these empirically derived, heterogeneous mutation models are incorporated into phylogenetic analyses, they significantly alter estimations of divergence times and dN/dS ratios. Our results demonstrate that non-random mutational processes are a powerful, often overlooked, force in shaping genome architecture and molecular evolution.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Mutational Bias in Germline Genomes Challenges Assumptions of Neutral Molecular Evolution
"The prevalence of sexual reproduction despite its twofold cost remains a central paradox in evolutionary biology. The Red Queen Hypothesis (RQH) posits that sex is advantageous in coevolutionary arms races with parasites. We conducted a long-term experimental evolution study using the facultatively sexual rotifer Brachionus plicatilis and its sterilizing fungal parasite. We maintained sympatric and allopatric host-parasite populations under controlled conditions, manipulating the opportunity for sexual reproduction. As predicted by the RQH, host populations coevolving with parasites maintained significantly higher rates of sexual reproduction compared to parasite-free controls. Time-shift infection assays demonstrated that parasites were more virulent on contemporary hosts than on past or future hosts, consistent with negative frequency-dependent selection. Furthermore, genomic analysis revealed rapid allelic turnover at host immune loci in sexual populations, a dynamic absent in asexual lineages which invariably went extinct. This study provides direct empirical validation that antagonistic coevolution is a potent selective force maintaining sexual reproduction.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Experimental Test of the Red Queen Hypothesis: Coevolution with Parasites Drives the Maintenance of Sex
"The Baldwin effect, whereby a plastic phenotype becomes genetically encoded, provides a compelling mechanism for adaptive evolution, yet its molecular basis is poorly understood. We investigated this process using an experimental population of Drosophila melanogaster selected for a novel heat-shock-induced wing morphology. Initially, the trait was purely plastic and dependent on Hsp90 buffering. Over 30 generations of selection, the trait became constitutively expressed even in the absence of the thermal stimulus, demonstrating genetic assimilation. Through quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and functional genomics, we pinpointed the causal locus to a cryptic variant within a distal enhancer of the wing-patterning gene vestigial (vg). This variant creates a novel binding site for a heat-inducible transcription factor. In the ancestral genetic background, its effect is buffered, but under thermal stress and subsequent selection, it becomes the target of strong positive selection, eventually fixing a canalized phenotype. This provides a direct molecular link between phenotypic plasticity, cryptic genetic variation, and genetic assimilation.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Genetic Assimilation of Phenotypic Plasticity via Cryptic Variation in a cis-Regulatory Element
"This paper introduces a novel framework for zero-shot causal inference by integrating deep generative models with symbolic logic programming. Our Neuro-Symbolic Causal Generative Model (NS-CGM) learns to construct and reason over structural causal models (SCMs) from high-dimensional observational data without interventional examples. The architecture employs a variational autoencoder to map raw data into a discretized latent space, where a differentiable logic tensor network subsequently infers causal relationships by optimizing a joint objective function that combines probabilistic reconstruction loss with a measure of logical consistency against a background knowledge base. We demonstrate that by enforcing symbolic constraints on the generative process, NS-CGM can extrapolate to unseen interventional distributions, effectively performing zero-shot causal discovery. Experiments on synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks show a significant improvement in structural accuracy and counterfactual prediction over purely neural or traditional constraint-based methods, especially in low-data regimes.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Neuro-Symbolic Generative Models for Zero-Shot Causal Inference
"The prevalence of non-IID (non-independently and identically distributed) data presents a primary obstacle to effective federated learning (FL). We propose Federated Hypernetwork-Modulated Meta-Learning (FedHML), a novel algorithm that addresses client drift and personalization in heterogeneous environments. FedHML leverages a central hypernetwork to generate the parameters of personalized client models, conditioned on low-dimensional client embeddings learned during training. This approach eschews traditional model averaging, instead meta-learning an initialization that rapidly adapts to a client's local data distribution with a few gradient steps. The hypernetwork architecture implicitly regularizes the personalization process, mitigating catastrophic forgetting of global knowledge while promoting specialized performance. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees and empirically demonstrate that FedHML significantly outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods like FedAvg, Per-FedAvg, and FedFomo on benchmark datasets with pathological non-IID partitions, achieving faster convergence and higher final accuracy across clients.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Federated Meta-Learning on Non-IID Data via Hypernetwork-Modulated Personalization

This work introduces Geodesic-Aware Graph Attention Networks (GeoGAT), a novel GNN architecture designed for dynamic, manifold-valued graph data. GeoGAT models spatio-temporal dependencies by propagating information along geodesics of the underlying Riemannian manifold. We replace standard linear transformations and dot-product attention with operations grounded in Riemannian geometry, such as logarithmic maps for local feature linearization and exponential maps for aggregation. The attention mechanism computes compatibility scores based on geodesic distances, ensuring the model respects the intrinsic curvature of the data space. We evaluate GeoGAT on dynamic brain connectome analysis using fMRI data modeled on the manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices.

"Decentralized learning systems are vulnerable to Byzantine attacks, where malicious nodes can arbitrarily corrupt model updates, leading to convergence failure. We introduce Byzantine-Robust Decentralized Gradient Aggregation (BRDGA), a framework that ensures resilience without a trusted central server. BRDGA integrates three key components: (1) low-rank gradient quantization to bound the influence of any single node, (2) a peer-to-peer verifiable delay function (VDF) to enforce computational costs on generating updates, thus thwarting cheap Sybil attacks, and (3) a robust aggregation rule based on geometric median filtering in the quantized space. This combination provably guarantees convergence in the presence of a constant fraction of Byzantine adversaries under standard assumptions on the loss function's convexity. Our empirical evaluation on large-scale image classification tasks demonstrates that BRDGA maintains high accuracy under severe poisoning and model replacement attacks, significantly outperforming existing robust aggregation methods like Krum and Trimmed Mean.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Byzantine-Robust Decentralized Learning with Quantized Gradient Aggregation and Verifiable Delay Functions

This paper presents the Information-Theoretic Disentanglement Network (InfoD-Net), a self-supervised framework that achieves state-of-the-art disentanglement without requiring generative factor labels. InfoD-Net augments a standard variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture with a structured information bottleneck. We introduce a novel objective function that maximizes the mutual information between latent variables and augmented views of the input while simultaneously minimizing the total correlation among the latent dimensions. This pressure encourages each latent unit to encode a compact, independent, and informative aspect of the data. Unlike prior methods that rely on heuristic regularizers, our approach is grounded in information theory. We demonstrate qualitatively and quantitatively on dSprites, MPI3D, and CelebA datasets that InfoD-Net learns more interpretable and modular representations than β-VAE and other leading methods.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Self-Supervised Disentanglement of Latent Representations using Information-Theoretic Bottlenecks
"Recent work has conceptualized deep neural networks as discretizations of continuous-time dynamical systems, or Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs). We extend this paradigm to the stochastic domain by proposing Equivariant Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (EN-SDEs). Our framework models the feature transformation process as a solution to an SDE, allowing for the construction of infinitely deep architectures with trainable drift and diffusion terms. This continuous-depth formulation enables the precise enforcement of group equivariances by constraining the vector fields of the SDE to be equivariant under the action of a given symmetry group. We develop a novel reversible and memory-efficient SDE solver that preserves these symmetries throughout the integration process. This approach not only provides a principled way to build deep equivariant models for data like point clouds and molecular structures but also offers inherent robustness to adversarial perturbations due to the stochastic nature of the forward pass.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Stochastic Differential Equation Solvers for Training Infinitely Deep Equivariant Networks
"Fusing information from disparate modalities remains a key challenge in multi-modal machine learning. We introduce the Holographic Transformer (HoloFormer), an architecture that leverages principles from Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs) to create unified, modality-invariant representations. HoloFormer employs holographic reduced representations (HRRs) to bind token embeddings from different sources (e.g., text, vision, audio) into a single high-dimensional vector space. The core operation is circular convolution, a computationally efficient binding operator that preserves semantic similarity. This pre-fused holographic representation is then processed by a standard transformer encoder, which learns context-aware cross-modal relationships within a unified space. This approach contrasts with late-fusion or cross-attention mechanisms that maintain separate modality streams. We show that HoloFormer achieves superior performance on VQA, text-to-video retrieval, and audio-visual event localization benchmarks while being more parameter-efficient than state-of-the-art multi-modal transformers.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Holographic Reduced Representations in Multi-Modal Transformer Architectures
"While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities, they often produce confident yet incorrect responses, lacking reliable uncertainty quantification. We address this critical gap by introducing Conformalized Quantile Regression for Language Models (CTRL). CTRL is a post-hoc calibration method that transforms the raw output logits of any pre-trained LLM into statistically valid prediction intervals. By applying the principles of conformal prediction to a quantile regression head trained on the LLM's internal representations, CTRL generates token-level uncertainty bounds that are guaranteed to achieve a user-specified marginal coverage rate. This non-parametric approach makes no distributional assumptions about the model's errors. We demonstrate that CTRL provides well-calibrated and adaptive uncertainty estimates for a variety of tasks, including machine translation and abstractive summarization. These rigorous uncertainty bounds enable safer model deployment by allowing for reliable selective prediction and active learning querying.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Calibrating Uncertainty in Large Language Models via Conformalized Quantile Regression
"Sim-to-real transfer in reinforcement learning is often hampered by the 'reality gap,' where discrepancies between simulation and the real world degrade policy performance. We present Adversarial Dynamics Matching for Deformable Objects (ADePT), a novel policy optimization framework for complex manipulation tasks. ADePT employs a two-player, minimax game: a policy network is trained via proximal policy optimization (PPO) to perform a task, while a trajectory-level discriminator is trained to distinguish between simulated and real-world rollouts. The policy is incentivized not only by the task reward but also by an adversarial loss that encourages it to generate trajectories that are indistinguishable from reality. This implicitly forces the policy to be robust to unmodeled physical dynamics and sensor noise. We demonstrate successful zero-shot transfer of a learned cloth-folding policy from a MuJoCo simulation to a physical robotic arm, a task notoriously difficult for traditional domain randomization techniques.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Adversarial Policy Optimization for Sim-to-Real Transfer in Deformable Object Manipulation
"Deep generative models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) learn to approximate complex, high-dimensional data distributions. However, understanding the geometric and topological structure of the learned data manifold remains an open challenge. This work leverages tools from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to provide a novel, quantitative lens for inspecting these models. We employ persistent homology to compute the topological signatures (Betti numbers) of the output manifold generated by sampling from the latent space. By analyzing the persistence diagrams, we can identify and quantify pathological behaviors such as mode collapse, where the generated manifold has a simpler topology than the true data manifold. We propose a new metric, the Topological Fidelity Score (TFS), based on the Wasserstein distance between persistence diagrams of real and generated data. Our analysis reveals previously unobserved structural flaws in popular GAN architectures and demonstrates that TFS is a more sensitive indicator of generative quality than traditional metrics like FID or Inception Score.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Topological Data Analysis for Probing the Intrinsic Dimensionality of Deep Generative Models
"The maintenance of pluripotency is governed by a precise network of transcription factors and epigenetic regulators, including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Here, we identify LncPluri-1, a novel nuclear-retained lncRNA highly expressed in embryonic stem cells. Through a combination of Chromatin Isolation by RNA Purification (ChIRP-seq) and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP-qPCR), we demonstrate that LncPluri-1 directly binds to SUZ12, a core component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). This interaction is essential for guiding PRC2 to specific developmental gene promoters, thereby mediating their H3K27 trimethylation and subsequent transcriptional silencing. Genetic depletion of LncPluri-1 via CRISPR-Cas9 results in aberrant expression of lineage-specifying genes and triggers premature differentiation, even under pluripotency-maintaining conditions. Our findings reveal that LncPluri-1 functions as a critical epigenetic scaffold, ensuring the spatiotemporal fidelity of PRC2 activity to safeguard the pluripotent state.

"The cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) involves the rapid assembly of large, dynamic protein assemblies known as repair foci. The biophysical principles governing their formation remain enigmatic. We demonstrate that the key repair factor 53BP1 undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) to form biomolecular condensates at sites of DNA damage. Using super-resolution microscopy and in vitro reconstitution assays, we show that multivalent interactions mediated by the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) and oligomerization domain of 53BP1 drive its condensation. These liquid-like droplets effectively concentrate downstream repair factors, including RIF1 and PTIP, while excluding others. Mutagenesis of key residues within the IDR that disrupt phase separation abolishes foci formation in vivo, compromises non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), and sensitizes cells to ionizing radiation. Our results establish that LLPS is a fundamental organizing principle for the spatiotemporal orchestration of the DNA damage response, providing a new paradigm for understanding genome maintenance.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation of 53BP1 is a Prerequisite for Robust Double-Strand Break Repair Foci Assembly
"Human telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) enzyme essential for maintaining genome integrity, is a premier target for anti-cancer therapeutics.

Here, we present the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the catalytically active human telomerase holoenzyme bound to the TEL patch of TPP1, a key shelterin component, at a near-atomic resolution of 3.1 Å. The structure reveals an intricate network of interactions and a previously uncharacterized interface between the CR4/5 domain of the telomerase RNA component (hTR) and the OB-fold domain of TPP1. This specific RNA-protein contact is critical for proper enzyme positioning at the chromosome terminus and enhances processivity.

"Aberrant epigenetic modifications, particularly DNA hypermethylation, are implicated in the transcriptional dysregulation observed in Huntington's disease (HD). The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene, critical for neuronal survival, is a key target of this silencing. We developed a CRISPR-based epigenome editing tool, fusing a nuclease-dead Cas9 (dCas9) to the catalytic domain of the DNA demethylase TET1, to specifically reverse this pathogenic mark. Using adeno-associated virus (AAV) delivery into the striatum of R6/2 HD model mice, we targeted the hypermethylated BDNF promoter IV. Bisulfite sequencing confirmed precise and efficient demethylation, which was accompanied by the restoration of active H3K4me3 histone marks and a significant recovery of BDNF transcription. Crucially, this targeted epigenetic reprogramming rescued synaptic plasticity deficits, as measured by long-term potentiation (LTP), and ameliorated motor coordination impairments.

"The selective removal of damaged mitochondria via mitophagy is a critical cellular quality control process, primarily regulated by the PINK1 kinase and PARKIN E3 ligase. Here we identify an alternative, PARKIN-independent branch of this pathway orchestrated by the outer mitochondrial membrane E3 ligase, MITOL (MARCH5). Upon mitochondrial depolarization, PINK1 phosphorylates MITOL, enhancing its E3 ligase activity. We performed quantitative ubiquitin proteomics and identified the voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) as a primary MITOL substrate. MITOL-mediated K63-linked polyubiquitination of VDAC1 serves as a binding platform for autophagy receptor NDP52, directly linking damaged mitochondria to the autophagosome. Depletion of MITOL, but not PARKIN, impairs NDP52 recruitment and mitochondrial clearance in PARKIN-deficient cells.

"The ribosome is often considered a homogenous cellular machine, yet evidence for its heterogeneity is emerging. We investigated ribosomal composition changes under oxidative stress using quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics of affinity-purified ribosomes (Ribo-proteomics). Our data reveal a dynamic, stoichiometric switch between the ribosomal protein paralogues RPL10A and RPL10. Stress conditions induce the selective incorporation of RPL10 into translating ribosomes, displacing RPL10A. Ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) demonstrated that these RPL10-containing 'specialized' ribosomes exhibit altered translational efficiencies, showing a strong preference for mRNAs containing Internal Ribosome Entry Sites (IRES), such as those encoding pro-survival factors like XIAP. In vitro reconstitution experiments confirm that RPL10-containing ribosomes possess an intrinsically higher affinity for IRES elements. This paralogue switching represents a sophisticated regulatory layer of translational control, enabling cells to rapidly reprogram their proteome by customizing the translational machinery itself to selectively translate critical mRNAs during stress.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Stress-Induced Ribosomal Protein Paralogue Switching Creates Specialized Ribosomes for Preferential Translation
"Cells sense and respond to the mechanical properties of their environment through mechanotransduction, a process central to development and disease. The Hippo pathway effectors YAP/TAZ are key mediators of this process, yet the molecular mechanisms linking extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness to their activity are poorly defined. Using a combination of traction force microscopy and FRET-based biosensors, we demonstrate that Integrin-Linked Kinase (ILK) functions as a core mechanosensor at focal adhesions. On stiff substrates, ILK is activated and phosphorylates filamin A, increasing its binding affinity for actin filaments. This enhances the 'molecular clutch' engagement between integrins and the actin cytoskeleton, leading to increased intracellular tension. This tension directly inhibits the LATS1/2 kinases, thereby promoting the dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of YAP.

We demonstrate that this site is adjacent to a regulatory phosphorylation site and that these two PTMs are mutually exclusive, forming a 'phospho-SUMO switch'. Phosphorylation inhibits SUMOylation, while conditions promoting dephosphorylation enhance it. Critically, SUMOylation of BRAF V600E promotes its homodimerization, a key step for paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway and for acquiring resistance to RAF inhibitors.

While the CMB temperature bispectrum has stringently constrained the fNL parameter, higher-order correlators like the trispectrum provide an independent and potentially more sensitive probe of multi-field inflation models. Our methodology employs an optimal estimator formalism applied to the B-mode power spectrum and cross-correlations with E-modes, which are sensitive to the non-Gaussian modulation of the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We perform a comprehensive analysis incorporating foreground mitigation and instrumental systematics, marginalizing over cosmological parameters. The resulting constraint, τNL = -5.8 ± 6.5 × 10^3 (68% CL), significantly improves upon previous limits from temperature data alone.

Specifically, we identify a critical threshold in initial magnetization that separates two distinct relaxation pathways, characterized by divergent timescales for reaching the quasistationary state (QSS). We analyze the system's trajectory in phase space and compute the maximal Lyapunov exponent, revealing a non-monotonic dependence on energy that signals a complex interplay between chaotic mixing and collective behavior.

In contrast, post-merger disk winds and viscously driven ejecta contribute a more isotropic, lanthanide-rich 'red' component on longer timescales. By calculating synthetic light curves and spectra using time-dependent radiative transfer models, we show that merger asymmetry produces a distinct observational signature: a viewing-angle-dependent, multi-component kilonova.

"We formulate a continuum hydrodynamic theory for a two-dimensional active nematic liquid crystal to model the collective dynamics of the actomyosin cytoskeleton. The model couples a generalized Navier-Stokes equation with the dynamics of a nematic order parameter tensor, driven by an active stress proportional to local alignment. Linear stability analysis reveals a generic instability of the ordered state towards spontaneous flow, driven by the active stress. Numerical simulations of the full nonlinear equations demonstrate the emergence of a dynamically steady state of active turbulence, characterized by the continuous creation, motion, and annihilation of ±1/2 topological defects (disclinations). We analyze the defect kinetics and find that their statistical properties differ significantly from those in passive or thermally driven systems, with +1/2 defects exhibiting comet-like motility.

"The Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) serves as a temporal analog to Bell's inequality, testing the validity of macroscopic realism and non-invasive measurability. We present a robust experimental violation of the LGI using a superconducting transmon qubit subjected to weak, continuous microwave measurement. This approach allows us to track the quantum trajectories of the system's state without fully collapsing the wavefunction at each time step, thus minimally disturbing the system as required by the LGI's premises. By correlating measurement outcomes at different times, we construct the LGI correlation functions and demonstrate a statistically significant violation of S_3 ≤ 1, obtaining a value of S_3 = 1.38 ± 0.04. Our protocol carefully characterizes and mitigates the effects of measurement back-action and environmental decoherence, which can mimic a violation.

"Grand Unification Theories (GUTs) predict the ultimate instability of the proton, providing a rare experimental window into physics at scales far beyond the reach of colliders. This paper reports on a search for proton decay via the channel p+ -> e+ π0 using 450 kiloton-years of data from the Super-Kamiokande water Cherenkov detector. We have developed an advanced event reconstruction algorithm that utilizes deep convolutional neural networks to improve the selection efficiency and background rejection for this signature decay mode, which is favored by minimal SU(5) models. No significant excess of events over the expected atmospheric neutrino background was observed. We consequently set a new lower limit on the partial lifetime of the proton of τ(p+ -> e+ π0) > 2.4 × 10^34 years at 90% confidence level. This result places the most stringent constraints to date on non-supersymmetric SU(5) and SO(10) GUTs, severely constraining their parameter space and motivating further exploration of supersymmetric or alternative unification scenarios.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Fizik,Generated,Probing Grand Unification Theories through Precision Measurements of Proton Decay Channels
"This paper addresses the long-standing challenge of automating Schenkerian analysis directly from audio recordings.

The model employs a multi-scale architecture to process features at the note, motive, and phrase levels, with a self-attention mechanism designed to identify long-range dependencies characteristic of melodic fluency (Zug) and bass arpeggiation (Bassbrechung). Trained on a curated dataset of annotated recordings from the common-practice era, our system demonstrates a significant capacity to identify middleground prolongations and approximate the fundamental structure (Ursatz).

By converting chroma features from audio into high-dimensional point clouds, we construct a series of Vietoris-Rips simplicial complexes. The persistence diagrams derived from these complexes reveal topological invariants (Betti numbers) that characterize the connectivity and structure of the harmonic language. Our analysis of excerpts from Wagner and Liszt identifies persistent 1-cycles (loops) corresponding to recurring, non-functional triadic transformations and higher-dimensional voids that correlate with large-scale formal divisions.

The SBP method constructs a custom projection basis from the theoretical frequency ratios of a given microtonal scale (e.g., 31-EDO, just intonation systems) and applies it to high-resolution STFT frames. We evaluate the SBP features on tasks of interval classification and modality identification using a synthetic dataset and recordings of works by Harry Partch and Ben Johnston.

"Automatic transcription and analysis of polyphonic music requires accurate separation of individual melodic lines, a task complicated by timbral similarity and voice crossing. This study proposes a deep learning model for contrapuntal voice separation that integrates music-theoretic constraints directly into the learning process. We employ a U-Net architecture, which excels at image-to-image tasks, to map a magnitude spectrogram to a set of voice-specific spectrogram masks. Crucially, we introduce a novel regularization term in the loss function that penalizes outputs violating principles of parsimonious voice leading, derived from Fuxian counterpoint rules regarding melodic step-motion and interval resolution. Tested on the Bach Chorales and a dataset of keyboard fugues, our musically-constrained model significantly outperforms baseline source separation architectures in both signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) and, more importantly, in producing continuous, coherent, and musically plausible melodic lines. This hybrid approach demonstrates the power of combining data-driven learning with domain-specific theoretical knowledge.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Constrained Polyphonic Voice Separation using a Deep U-Net with Music-Theoretic Regularization

We adapt a temporal contrastive learning framework, training a deep convolutional network to identify whether two audio segments, extracted from a large corpus of classical music, are temporally adjacent or distant. The resulting learned embeddings are then evaluated on a downstream task of structural segmentation by applying k-means clustering. Without any exposure to formal labels, the system’s segment boundaries show a high degree of correlation with expert annotations of sonata and rondo forms (e.g., exposition, development, recapitulation).

By systematically sampling vectors along principal axes and geodesic paths within the latent space and generating the corresponding audio, we map its topology. We employ multidimensional scaling (MDS) on listener-rated perceptual dissimilarity data and correlate the resulting dimensions with a suite of psychoacoustic features (e.g., spectral centroid, roughness, attack time, inharmonicity). Our results reveal that the GAN has organized its latent space into perceptually coherent, continuous manifolds corresponding to abstract timbral qualities.

Existing autocorrelation-based methods are often brittle and sensitive to tempo fluctuations. We propose a novel approach based on multi-resolution analysis using the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT). An onset detection function is first computed from the audio signal to represent its rhythmic surface. We then apply a CWT to this function using a Morlet wavelet, generating a scalogram that reveals periodicities across a continuous range of temporal scales. Peaks in the scalogram's energy integrated over specific scale ranges correspond to dominant periodicities at tactus, measure, and hyper-measure levels. Evaluated on a corpus of Beethoven piano sonatas, our CWT-based method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in identifying duple and quadruple hypermetric structures, proving more robust to expressive variations in tempo and dynamics.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Hypermeter Detection via Multi-Resolution Analysis with Continuous Wavelet Transforms

We model musical excerpts as dynamic graphs where pitch-classes are nodes and edges are weighted by theoretical relationships, such as interval-class content and adjacency. A GNN is then trained on these graph representations to perform formal section classification and to identify recurring transformational networks. By learning to convolve filters over the graph structure, the model effectively learns to recognize transposed and inverted set-classes (T_n/I_n operations) and identifies abstract relationships like the Z-relation. Applied to works from the Second Viennese School, our GNN model achieves high accuracy in segmenting compositions based on underlying set-class usage, providing a powerful computational lens for exploring the complex symmetries and organizational principles of atonal music.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Graph Neural Networks for the Analysis of Pitch-Class Set Transformations in Atonal Music

We then perform a detailed analysis of the learned attention maps, which visualize the inter-chordal relationships the model prioritizes for its predictions. The results show that the attention heads learn to focus on structurally significant, non-adjacent chords, effectively identifying tonic-dominant axes, prolongational spans, and the syntactic antecedents of applied chords.

Our construction allows for an explicit operator-level reconstruction of bulk local operators acting deep within the anti-de Sitter (AdS) geometry from their corresponding boundary conformal field theory (CFT) representations. This 'entanglement wedge reconstruction' is shown to be isometric, providing a concrete realization of the quantum error-correcting code properties of holography. We further explore the sub-AdS locality and the constraints imposed by the entanglement structure on bulk causality, offering a new perspective on how classical spacetime geometry can emerge from the quantum entanglement of a boundary theory.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Kuantum,Generated,Bulk Reconstruction from Boundary Entanglement via Perfect Tensor Networks
"We investigate the phenomenon of many-body localization (MBL) in a periodically driven, disordered Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain using large-scale exact diagonalization and time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithms. Our study reveals a stable MBL phase in this Floquet system, characterized by a breakdown of thermalization and the preservation of local quantum information. We observe a hallmark logarithmic growth of entanglement entropy following a global quantum quench, a definitive signature of MBL that distinguishes it from both Anderson localization and ergodic quantum systems. By constructing an effective Hamiltonian, we demonstrate the existence of an extensive set of quasi-local integrals of motion (l-bits) that are responsible for this emergent integrability. We map out the phase diagram as a function of driving frequency and disorder strength, identifying a sharp MBL transition whose critical properties challenge existing theories based on avalanche instabilities, suggesting a distinct universality class for Floquet MBL.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Kuantum,Generated,Logarithmic Entanglement Spreading and Emergent Integrability in a Disordered Floquet Spin Chain
"We present a novel interferometric protocol that leverages multimode entangled states to achieve phase estimation at the fundamental Heisenberg limit. The scheme employs a balanced homodyne detection apparatus fed with a specially prepared two-mode squeezed vacuum state, which is subsequently passed through a network of beam splitters to generate a highly non-classical, multimode entangled probe. By calculating the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) for this state with respect to the differential phase shift, we prove that the sensitivity scales as 1/N, where N is the mean total photon number, thus saturating the quantum Cramér-Rao bound. This represents a significant improvement over the standard quantum limit (1/√N). Our theoretical analysis, supported by numerical simulations of the Wigner function evolution, demonstrates robustness against moderate photon loss and detection inefficiencies, making it a viable candidate for next-generation gravitational wave detectors and quantum-enhanced sensing technologies.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Kuantum,Generated,Heisenberg-Limited Phase Estimation via Multimode Squeezed-State Interferometry
"We report the experimental realization of a superradiant phase transition in a system comprising a transmon qubit ensemble coupled to a high-Q superconducting resonator, operating in the deep ultrastrong-coupling regime. Here, the collective light-matter coupling strength exceeds the individual qubit and resonator frequencies. By tuning the qubit frequencies into resonance, we observe a spontaneous emergence of a macroscopic photonic field in the resonator ground state, a hallmark of the Dicke superradiant phase. Crucially, the system's quantum nature manifests as a 'vacuum blockade' effect, where the discreteness of the photon field significantly alters the phase diagram from the mean-field prediction. Using in-situ dispersive readout and Wigner tomography, we characterize the entangled ground state, revealing a non-classical Schrödinger cat state of the electromagnetic field.

We present an experimental verification of this equality in a purely quantum regime using a single trapped 171Yb+ ion. The ion's internal spin states represent the thermodynamic system, while its motional state in a Paul trap acts as a work reservoir. We implement a quantum nanomotor protocol by applying a series of laser-induced state manipulations and controlled displacements, driving the system far from equilibrium. By reconstructing the full quantum work distribution from repeated measurements, we confirm the validity of the Jarzynski equality with high precision. Furthermore, we investigate the dissipation and entropy production in the quantum limit, providing direct experimental insight into the foundations of quantum thermodynamics and the arrow of time.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Kuantum,Generated,Experimental Verification of the Quantum Jarzynski Equality with a Trapped-Ion Nanomotor
"The superfluid weight, a measure of a superconductor's ability to support dissipationless current, is conventionally linked to the kinetic energy of charge carriers. Here, we present a theoretical framework demonstrating that quantum geometry of the Bloch states provides a significant, previously overlooked contribution to the superfluid weight in d-wave superconductors, particularly in the underdoped cuprates. Using a slave-boson mean-field theory of the t-J model, we calculate the Fubini-Study metric tensor of the Hilbert space of quasiparticle states. We show that the integral of this quantum metric over the Brillouin zone yields a geometric contribution to the superfluid density that is distinct from the conventional term derived from the band dispersion. This geometric term becomes particularly dominant in the pseudogap regime as the Fermi surface deconstructs into arcs, offering a compelling explanation for the observed robustness of superconductivity despite a low density of states at the Fermi level.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Kuantum,Generated,Quantum Geometric Contribution to the Superfluid Weight in d-Wave Superconductors
"We analyze quantum information protocols for observers in non-inertial frames and curved spacetime backgrounds. Specifically, we investigate the 'entanglement harvesting' protocol, where two initially uncorrelated, accelerated Unruh-DeWitt detectors can extract entanglement from the vacuum state of a quantum field. Using Bogoliubov transformations, we compute the harvested concurrence for observers in Rindler spacetime, demonstrating a strong dependence on their proper acceleration and separation. We find a critical acceleration beyond which entanglement extraction becomes impossible. Subsequently, we study the fidelity of a quantum teleportation channel established between these accelerated observers using the harvested entanglement as a resource. Our results show a direct correlation between the degradation of teleportation fidelity and the thermal noise perceived by the observers due to the Unruh effect.

This method, termed Variational Quantum Homology (VQH), maps a simplicial complex derived from the data onto a series of qubit Hamiltonians whose ground state degeneracies correspond to the desired Betti numbers. We employ a Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) with a hardware-efficient ansatz to find these ground states on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. A key innovation is a symmetry-projection technique that mitigates the effects of noise and significantly reduces the required number of measurements. We demonstrate the protocol by successfully computing the Betti numbers of canonical topological objects (e.g., tori and spheres) on a simulated noisy quantum processor and an actual superconducting qubit device.

"Axion-like particles (ALPs) are a well-motivated dark matter candidate that can couple to photons through a Chern-Simons term, leading to unique signatures in cosmological observations. We present a comprehensive theoretical treatment of the frequency-dependent cosmic birefringence and dichroism induced by an oscillating background axion field. This interaction violates parity and CPT, causing a rotation of the linear polarization plane and a conversion of linear to circular polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and other astrophysical sources. We derive the transfer matrix for polarized light propagating through the axion dark matter background, accounting for temporal and spatial field fluctuations. By analyzing the latest CMB polarization data from Planck and ACT, we establish new, stringent constraints on the axion-photon coupling constant g_aγγ across a wide range of axion masses (10^-22 eV to 10^-12 eV), improving existing limits by up to two orders of magnitude in certain regimes.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Kuantum,Generated,Cosmological Birefringence and Dichroism as Probes of Axion-Photon Coupling
"Persistent homology has emerged as a powerful technique for characterizing the multi-scale topological features of data. However, a significant gap remains in performing rigorous statistical inference on these features. This paper develops a novel inferential framework for persistence diagrams, the primary output of persistent homology. We introduce a multi-scale bootstrap procedure for constructing confidence regions for topological features, such as connected components (0-dimensional holes) and loops (1-dimensional holes). By resampling from the empirical data distribution and computing bottleneck or Wasserstein distances between persistence diagrams, we quantify the variability of observed topological structures. We prove the asymptotic validity and consistency of our method under mild assumptions on the underlying data-generating manifold. The utility of our approach is demonstrated through simulations on synthetic point clouds sampled from tori and spheres, and an application to a complex biological dataset, where we successfully differentiate topological signals from sampling noise and perform hypothesis tests on the data's intrinsic shape.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,Topological Data Analysis with Persistent Homology: A Framework for Statistical Inference
"The performance of standard high-dimensional estimators, such as the Lasso, degrades substantially under heavy-tailed error distributions or adversarial data contamination. We introduce Adaptive Huber Regression, a novel penalized method that provides robust estimation in high-dimensional linear models. The method minimizes a Huber-type loss function in tandem with an L1-penalty. Crucially, the robustness parameter of the Huber loss, which delineates between quadratic and absolute loss, is adaptively and iteratively estimated from the data. This data-driven tuning procedure obviates the need for manual parameter selection, a significant practical challenge for robust methods. We establish finite-sample oracle inequalities, proving that our estimator achieves near-optimal statistical error rates under minimal moment conditions on the error distribution. Extensive numerical experiments confirm that our method consistently outperforms the Lasso, SQRT-Lasso, and other robust estimators across a wide spectrum of contamination models, demonstrating its theoretical soundness and practical utility for modern data analysis.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,Adaptive Huber Regression for Robust Estimation in High-Dimensional Linear Models
"The Stochastic Block Model (SBM) is a foundational tool for community detection in network data. However, standard SBMs are static and cannot incorporate node-specific attributes. We propose a dynamic mixed-membership SBM where node community affiliations evolve over time according to a hidden Markov model. Furthermore, the block interaction probabilities are modeled as a function of nodal covariates via a logistic link, providing interpretable explanations for community formation and evolution. To handle the computational challenges, we derive a scalable stochastic variational inference algorithm for approximate posterior computation, enabling application to massive, time-resolved networks. We establish theoretical guarantees on the consistency of community assignments under this framework. The model's efficacy is demonstrated on a longitudinal social network and a dynamic protein-protein interaction network, where it uncovers meaningful temporal shifts in community structure that are correlated with external events and node attributes, significantly outperforming static and covariate-agnostic models in link prediction tasks.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,Bayesian Inference for Dynamic Stochastic Block Models with Covariate Information
"Functional Data Analysis (FDA) provides a powerful framework for modeling relationships between functional variables. A common challenge arises when functional covariates are observed sparsely and irregularly across subjects, precluding standard estimation methods. We propose a penalized estimation approach within a mixed-effects model framework to address this issue. The unknown functional coefficient is represented via a B-spline basis expansion, with a roughness penalty imposed on the basis coefficients to enforce smoothness, effectively regularizing the solution within a Sobolev space. We develop a computationally efficient Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to handle the missing data structure inherent in sparse observations. Asymptotic properties, including consistency and convergence rates of the estimated coefficient function, are rigorously established. We show the estimator achieves optimal rates under certain conditions on the sampling design and the smoothness of the underlying functions.

"Constructing prediction intervals with valid finite-sample coverage guarantees is a fundamental statistical problem. Traditional methods often rely on strong, and frequently violated, distributional assumptions. This paper introduces Conformalized Quantile Regression (CQR), a methodology that synergizes the flexibility of quantile regression with the rigorous distribution-free guarantees of conformal prediction. The method first employs any quantile regression algorithm to estimate conditional quantiles, forming initial prediction intervals. These intervals are then calibrated on a separate calibration set using a non-conformity score based on the quantile loss. We prove that under the sole assumption of data exchangeability, CQR produces prediction intervals with guaranteed marginal coverage in finite samples, irrespective of the underlying data distribution or the accuracy of the initial quantile regression model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CQR consistently achieves the target coverage rate where standard parametric and bootstrap intervals fail, while maintaining narrow, informative interval widths across diverse and complex regression tasks.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,Conformalized Quantile Regression for Distribution-Free Prediction Intervals
"In survival analysis with competing risks, directly modeling the cumulative incidence function (CIF) is often more interpretable than modeling subdistribution hazards. We propose a novel, flexible regression framework for the CIF in the presence of high-dimensional covariates. Our approach is based on pseudo-values, which are constructed from jackknife leave-one-out estimates of the non-parametric Aalen-Johansen estimator of the CIF. These pseudo-values serve as responses in a generalized estimating equation (GEE) framework, allowing for the direct modeling of covariate effects on the CIF at specific time points. To accommodate high-dimensional predictors, we incorporate an elastic net penalty into the GEE estimation. We establish the asymptotic consistency and normality of the resulting estimators under suitable regularity conditions. Simulation studies show that our method provides accurate parameter estimates and superior predictive performance compared to high-dimensional adaptations of the Fine-Gray model. The method's utility is illustrated via an analysis of a cancer genomics dataset, identifying key prognostic biomarkers for cause-specific mortality.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,Pseudo-Value Regression for Direct Modeling of the Cumulative Incidence Function with High-Dimensional Covariates
"Explaining the impressive generalization performance of over-parameterized deep neural networks (DNNs) remains a central challenge in statistical learning theory. We derive novel, data-dependent generalization bounds for DNNs within the PAC-Bayesian framework that are empirically non-vacuous for modern architectures. Our approach defines a posterior distribution over network weights that is concentrated in regions of the parameter space characterized by flat minima of the empirical risk landscape. The complexity of this posterior, measured via the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence from a data-independent prior, forms the core of our bound. We propose a practical algorithm based on Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) to sample from this posterior and numerically evaluate the bound. We prove that the resulting bound is tighter than many existing complexity-based bounds (e.g., those based on Rademacher complexity or parameter norms) and scales favorably with network width. Empirical evaluation on benchmark image classification tasks demonstrates that our computed bounds are numerically tight and correlate strongly with observed test accuracy.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,İstatistik,Generated,Generalization Bounds for Deep Neural Networks via PAC-Bayesian Complexity and Langevin Dynamics

This paper presents a refined HDP formulation and derives a novel, efficient collapsed Gibbs sampler for posterior inference. By integrating out the infinite-dimensional random measures at each level of the hierarchy, our sampler improves mixing and convergence properties compared to existing algorithms. We establish the theoretical underpinnings of the model and detail its posterior predictive distributions. The model's efficacy is demonstrated in two distinct domains: topic modeling in text corpora, where documents are grouped into a corpus, and cell-type discovery in single-cell RNA sequencing data, where cells are grouped by patient.

Our method provides sub-cent pitch resolution and precise temporal localization of partials, enabling a direct comparison between performed inharmonic spectra and the composers' prescribed harmonic models derived from acoustic phenomena. We introduce a novel metric, the 'spectral deviation index' (SDI), to quantify the divergence between performed microtonal inflections and their theoretical targets.

Pairwise dissimilarity matrices derived from these features were used as input for the MDS algorithm, generating a low-dimensional Euclidean space. The resulting dimensions robustly correlated with established perceptual attributes, such as brightness, richness, and attack intensity. Crucially, the topological organization of instruments within this space aligns closely with principles from historical orchestration treatises (e.g., Berlioz, Rimsky-Korsakov), providing an empirical validation of traditional instrumental blending and family groupings.

We employ wavelet analysis for robust onset detection and microtiming extraction from audio signals. The proposed metric is tested on two stylistically distinct corpora known for their rhythmic intricacy: progressive jazz (e.g., Dave Brubeck Quartet) and Bulgarian folk music in asymmetric meters.

These computationally derived boundaries (e.g., exposition-development, development-recapitulation) were then used to time-lock and analyze EEG data recorded from musically trained and untrained listeners. Our findings reveal a distinct P300 event-related potential (ERP) component in trained listeners that is significantly larger at major formal junctures, particularly at the onset of the recapitulation.

Using in vitro reconstitution assays, we show that these IDRs drive the formation of phase-separated droplets that selectively recruit RNA Polymerase II and transcription factors. Super-resolution microscopy in murine embryonic stem cells reveals that mutations disrupting these multivalent interactions abrogate the formation of stable transcriptional condensates, leading to diminished expression of key pluripotency genes.

Using ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq), we investigated the dynamics of translation elongation in human cells exposed to acute hypoxia. Our analysis revealed widespread ribosome stalling at specific proline codons (CCU and CCC) within actively translated mRNAs. This stalling was not correlated with mRNA abundance but was directly associated with a significant decrease in the cellular levels of the corresponding tRNA-Pro isoacceptors, as measured by tRNA sequencing. The selective translation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α), which is notably poor in these proline codons, was consequently enhanced.

Using in vitro reconstitution and cell-based assays, we show that this K63-linked ubiquitination event does not target p62 for proteasomal degradation but instead triggers a conformational change that promotes its higher-order oligomerization into functional polymers. These p62 polymers exhibit enhanced avidity for ubiquitinated cargo and efficiently recruit the autophagosome initiation machinery.

We show that exposure of *Caenorhabditis elegans* to the pathogenic bacterium *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* induces a learned olfactory avoidance behavior that is robustly inherited for at least four subsequent generations in the absence of the initial stimulus. Using targeted genetic perturbations and genome-wide ChIP-seq, we demonstrate that this transgenerational memory is dependent on the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and the propagation of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) in the germline. We identified a specific chemosensory gene, *srsx-1*, that acquires H3K27me3 marks upon parental exposure, leading to its transcriptional silencing in progeny. Re-activating this gene erases the inherited behavior. Our findings provide a direct mechanistic link between a histone modification, gene expression, and the transgenerational inheritance of an acquired adaptive behavior.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Transgenerational Inheritance of an Olfactory Avoidance Behavior in C. elegans is Mediated by Germline H3K27me3 Propagation
"Telomeres are protected from being recognized as DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by the shelterin complex. Loss of the shelterin component TRF2 exposes chromosome ends, which are then prone to aberrant repair by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), leading to telomere fusions and genomic instability. We investigated the DNA damage response (DDR) at these de-protected telomeres. Here we show that the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase is rapidly activated and directly phosphorylates TRF2 at a novel serine residue (S315) upon telomere uncapping. Using phosphomimetic and non-phosphorylatable mutants, we demonstrate that pS315-TRF2 actively inhibits the recruitment of the NHEJ factor 53BP1 to telomeres. Instead, this phosphorylation event promotes the recruitment of components of the homology-directed repair (HDR) pathway, facilitating conservative repair. This ATM-mediated phosphorylation of TRF2 thus acts as a crucial molecular switch that dictates DNA repair pathway choice at damaged telomeres, thereby safeguarding chromosome integrity.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,ATM-Dependent Phosphorylation of TRF2 is a Critical Switch for Repair Pathway Choice at De-protected Telomeres
"Synthetic gene circuits offer powerful tools for programming complex cellular behaviors. Here, we report the design and implementation of a robust, bistable genetic toggle switch in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). The circuit is built from orthogonal CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) and interference (CRISPRi) components, where two guide RNAs (gRNAs) are designed to mutually repress each other's promoters via dCas9-KRAB, while simultaneously activating their own expression through dCas9-VPR. This architecture creates two stable, heritable states. Using transient delivery of activator or repressor molecules, we can controllably flip the switch between a SOX2-high/BRACHYURY-low pluripotency state and a SOX2-low/BRACHYURY-high mesodermal progenitor state. The chosen state is maintained through multiple cell divisions after the initial stimulus is removed. This synthetic circuit provides a powerful platform for dissecting the principles of cell fate decisions and for engineering predictable cellular therapies.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,An Orthogonal CRISPRa/i-Based Toggle Switch Enables Programmable and Heritable Cell Fate Control in Human Pluripotent Stem Cells
"Conventional self-supervised learning methods, primarily based on instance discrimination, often risk learning spurious correlations and suffer from representation collapse. We introduce a novel framework, TopoCLR, that integrates topological data analysis (TDA) as a supervisory signal. Our approach extends the contrastive loss paradigm by incorporating a regularization term that encourages the latent space manifold to preserve the topological invariants, specifically the Betti numbers, of the input data's underlying geometric structure. By computing persistent homology on mini-batches and penalizing deviations in the latent representation's topological signature, TopoCLR learns more robust and generalizable features. This method explicitly discourages dimensional collapse and enhances semantic clustering. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on downstream tasks including image classification and object detection, particularly under domain shift conditions, validating the efficacy of imposing topological priors for learning meaningful, high-quality representations without explicit labels.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Topological Priors for Self-Supervised Representation Learning
"This paper presents BR-FedTrust, a novel Byzantine-resilient federated learning (FL) framework designed for robustness in adversarial, decentralized environments. Existing defenses against data poisoning and model inversion attacks often rely on a centralized server for aggregation, creating a single point of failure. BR-FedTrust obviates this by integrating a permissioned blockchain to maintain a decentralized trust ledger, where clients' contributions are weighted by a dynamically updated reputation score. We introduce a Byzantine-fault-tolerant consensus mechanism for secure gradient aggregation and employ client-level differential privacy with adaptive noise calibration to provide formal privacy guarantees. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that BR-FedTrust achieves convergence under a bounded number of Byzantine clients. Empirically, on non-IID data distributions, our framework demonstrates superior resilience to sophisticated attacks compared to state-of-the-art robust FL algorithms, maintaining high model utility while ensuring client privacy.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Byzantine-Resilient Federated Learning with Decentralized Trust and Privacy Guarantees
"Predicting protein conformational dynamics is a fundamental challenge in structural biology. We propose Equivariant Riemannian Graph Networks (ERGNs), a novel geometric deep learning architecture that explicitly models the curved, non-Euclidean geometry of the protein's conformational space. ERGNs operate on a graph representation of the protein, where an SE(3)-equivariant message-passing scheme evolves node features along geodesic paths on a learned Riemannian manifold. This approach inherently respects the rotational and translational symmetries of the physical system, leading to superior data efficiency and generalization. By framing the prediction of conformational transitions as a flow-matching problem on this manifold, ERGNs accurately model complex dynamics and identify metastable states. We validate our model on molecular dynamics simulation data and experimental Cryo-EM datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in predicting transition pathways and free energy landscapes over existing Euclidean-based graph neural network architectures.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Equivariant Riemannian Graph Networks for Protein Conformational Dynamics
"Deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents often fail to generalize to novel environments due to their reliance on spurious correlations. We introduce Causal-Actor-Critic (CAC), a framework that endows RL agents with counterfactual reasoning capabilities by integrating a structural causal model (SCM) of the environment. The agent learns a latent SCM from observational and interventional data, enabling it to simulate interventions via the do-calculus. The policy and value functions are conditioned not only on the current state but also on the output of counterfactual predictions from the SCM. This allows the agent to distinguish causal relationships from mere statistical associations, leading to more robust and generalizable policies. The SCM parameters and the RL policy are optimized jointly through a bi-level optimization process. We demonstrate that CAC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art model-based and model-free RL algorithms in a series of challenging benchmarks that require causal understanding and transferability.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Counterfactual Policy Optimization via Integrated Structural Causal Models in Deep Reinforcement Learning

We propose a hybrid quantum-classical framework that leverages the structure of Tensor Networks (TNs) to mitigate this issue. Our method, named Quantum Tensor-Train Variational Optimizer (QTT-VO), represents the quantum state as a Matrix Product State (MPS) and variationally optimizes its constituent tensors. The optimization is performed on a classical computer, while a quantum co-processor is used to efficiently estimate the gradients and expectation values of local Hamiltonians. This decomposition reduces the effective number of optimized parameters and restricts the search space, demonstrably circumventing barren plateaus in deep quantum circuits. We provide theoretical guarantees on the gradient scaling and empirically validate our approach on quantum chemistry and combinatorial optimization problems, achieving faster convergence and superior accuracy compared to standard variational quantum eigensolvers.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Mitigating Barren Plateaus in Quantum Neural Networks with Variational Tensor Network Training

We introduce the Manifold-Constrained Variational Auto-Encoder GAN (MC-VAEGAN), a novel architecture that enforces disentanglement by regularizing the generator's Jacobian. We posit that a disentangled generator maps latent traversals to transformations along distinct semantic directions on the data manifold. This is enforced by a novel penalty term that promotes the orthogonality of the Jacobian's column vectors, weighted by the Riemannian metric of the latent space. This constraint ensures that perturbations in individual latent variables correspond to geometrically orthogonal flows on the output manifold. We provide a theoretical framework linking this geometric constraint to information-theoretic disentanglement metrics and demonstrate empirically that MC-VAEGAN achieves state-of-the-art disentanglement scores on benchmark datasets like dSprites and CelebA, while maintaining high generation quality.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Certifiably Disentangled Generative Models via Manifold-Constrained Jacobian Regularization
"We address catastrophic forgetting in continual learning by proposing a novel meta-learning framework, Meta-Manifold Continual Learning (M2CL). Our core hypothesis is that parameters for a sequence of related tasks lie on a shared low-dimensional manifold embedded within the high-dimensional weight space of a neural network. M2CL first meta-learns a low-dimensional generative model of this task manifold from a set of meta-training tasks. For subsequent continual learning, new tasks are learned by optimizing a short trajectory on this manifold, heavily regularizing out-of-manifold updates. This is achieved by projecting gradients onto the manifold's tangent space at each optimization step. This approach drastically reduces the effective number of parameters learned per task and preserves knowledge by constraining updates to a subspace known to be effective. We show that M2CL significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art continual learning methods on challenging benchmarks, demonstrating minimal forgetting and positive forward transfer.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Continual Meta-Learning on a Low-Dimensional Task Manifold

We present Synapse, a neuro-symbolic framework that synergizes the generative power of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the rigor of formal verification. Synapse operates in a generate-and-verify loop. An LLM, fine-tuned on code and formal specifications, generates a candidate program snippet. This code is then parsed into a structured intermediate representation and its semantics are translated into logical formulae. A Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver rigorously verifies the program against pre-defined formal specifications. If verification fails, the SMT solver produces a counterexample, which is fed back to the LLM as a corrective prompt to guide the generation of a refined candidate. This iterative refinement process combines the LLM's pattern recognition with the sound reasoning of formal methods, enabling the synthesis of non-trivial algorithms with provable correctness guarantees.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Neuro-Symbolic Program Synthesis with Large Language Models and SMT-Based Verification
"We introduce Synaptic Flux Optimization (SFO), a novel dynamic sparse training algorithm that optimizes network topology concurrently with its weights. Unlike conventional methods that prune post-training or use magnitude-based heuristics, SFO leverages second-order information to guide connectivity changes. At each training step, SFO identifies and prunes synapses with low saliency, estimated using a diagonal approximation of the Hessian, which measures their impact on the loss function. Concurrently, it reallocates the freed parameter budget by growing new connections where the gradient indicates a potential for maximal loss reduction. This continuous 'prune-and-regrow' process, analogous to synaptic plasticity, allows the network to dynamically adapt its sparse structure to the data distribution. SFO maintains a fixed sparsity level throughout training, yielding highly sparse models from scratch that achieve accuracy comparable to their dense counterparts, while significantly outperforming existing sparse training methods.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Synaptic Flux Optimization: Dynamic Sparse Training via Second-Order Information

We propose SNGP-Transformer, a method for equipping Transformer architectures with high-quality uncertainty quantification. Our approach replaces the final linear layer of the Transformer with a Spectral-Normalized Neural Gaussian Process (SNGP) layer. SNGP leverages a distance-preserving feature representation via spectral normalization and a Gaussian process output layer to provide calibrated uncertainty estimates with low computational overhead. This hybrid technique effectively captures both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, the latter via its sensitivity to out-of-domain inputs. We demonstrate that SNGP-Transformer significantly improves calibration error and out-of-domain detection performance on various natural language understanding tasks, including the GLUE benchmark, while maintaining competitive predictive accuracy and providing a principled mechanism for robust decision-making.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Calibrated and Robust Transformers using Spectral-Normalized Neural Gaussian Processes

We investigated the role of chromosomal inversions in driving ecological divergence and incipient speciation within the Anopheles gambiae species complex. Using whole-genome resequencing of populations across a latitudinal aridity gradient, we identified extensive differentiation concentrated within large, polymorphic inversions on chromosome 2. Linkage disequilibrium was significantly elevated within these inversions compared to collinear regions, indicating strong suppression of recombination. Population genetic analyses reveal that these inverted regions harbor clusters of alleles associated with desiccation resistance and insecticide tolerance, acting as 'supergenes' that maintain co-adapted gene complexes in the face of gene flow. Hybrid zone analyses further demonstrate that these inversions are associated with significant underdominance and contribute to hybrid inviability. Our findings provide robust evidence that chromosomal inversions facilitate rapid adaptive divergence by locking together advantageous allelic combinations, thereby acting as potent mechanistic drivers of ecological speciation.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Genomic Architecture of Speciation: Chromosomal Inversions as Supergenes Driving Reproductive Isolation in Anopheles gambiae

Using Bayesian ancestral sequence reconstruction and codon-based models of selection, we traced the molecular evolution of key toxin families, particularly three-finger toxins (3FTx) and phospholipases A2 (PLA2). Our time-calibrated phylogeny reveals multiple independent gene duplication events preceding major adaptive radiations. We identified specific residue substitutions under strong positive selection at critical ancestral nodes, which correlate with functional shifts from neurotoxicity to cytotoxicity. Notably, we uncovered compelling evidence for convergent evolution at the molecular level, where distinct lineages independently evolved identical functional motifs in their 3FTx repertoires. This study demonstrates how phylogenomic approaches can resolve the intricate interplay of gene duplication, neofunctionalization, and molecular convergence in the assembly of complex adaptive phenotypes.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Phylogenomic Reconstruction of Toxin Neofunctionalization in Elapid Snakes Reveals Convergent Molecular Trajectories
"Understanding the evolutionary trajectories leading to antimicrobial resistance is critical for predicting and managing its emergence. We conducted a long-term experimental evolution study using Escherichia coli under escalating concentrations of cefotaxime in a continuous culture system. By coupling high-throughput temporal genome sequencing with phenotypic assays, we characterized the mutational pathways to high-level resistance. We observed a strikingly parallel evolution at the gene level, with initial mutations consistently targeting the ampC promoter, followed by secondary mutations in genes modulating membrane permeability (e.g., ompF) and efflux (e.g., acrR). However, at the nucleotide level, the specific mutations were highly contingent on the initial genetic background. We quantified strong epistatic interactions, where early resistance mutations potentiated the fitness effects of subsequent compensatory mutations that mitigated the costs of resistance. Our results indicate that while the general pathway to resistance is predictable, historical contingency plays a significant role in shaping the specific genetic solutions, influencing the ultimate fitness and stability of resistant genotypes.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Predictability and Contingency in the Experimental Evolution of High-Level Cephalosporin Resistance

Through population genomic analysis of both species from multiple sympatric and allopatric sites, we characterized patterns of selection on host resistance (R) genes and pathogen avirulence (Avr) genes. We found strong signatures of balancing selection maintaining polymorphism at R loci, consistent with negative frequency-dependent selection. Furthermore, we observed a geographic mosaic of adaptation, where local pathogen populations exhibited significantly higher virulence on sympatric host genotypes. Genome-wide association scans identified specific R-Avr gene pairings responsible for local interaction patterns. These findings illustrate that co-evolution is not a uniform process, but a dynamic mosaic of local adaptation and counter-adaptation, generating and maintaining genetic diversity across the landscape.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Co-evolutionary Dynamics in a Plant-Pathogen System: A Geographic Mosaic of Reciprocal Adaptation
"Admixture between anatomically modern humans and archaic hominins, such as Neanderthals and Denisovans, has introduced genetic variation into the modern human gene pool. The functional and evolutionary significance of this introgression remains an area of intense investigation. By analyzing high-coverage paleogenomes of multiple archaic individuals alongside thousands of modern human genomes, we constructed a high-resolution map of archaic introgression. We integrated this map with functional genomic data, including eQTL and chromatin accessibility datasets. Our analysis reveals that introgressed haplotypes are significantly enriched for genes involved in innate immunity (e.g., the TLR1-6-10 cluster) and metabolic regulation, particularly lipid catabolism. These archaic alleles show strong signatures of positive selection in non-African populations. We posit that introgression provided a reservoir of locally adapted alleles that facilitated the rapid adaptation of modern humans to novel pathogens and dietary resources encountered during their expansion out of Africa, providing a compelling example of adaptive introgression.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Paleogenomic Evidence for Adaptive Archaic Introgression of Immune and Metabolic Alleles in Modern Humans
"Changes in gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are hypothesized to be a primary driver of morphological evolution. We explored this hypothesis by investigating the evolution of limb morphology in vertebrates, focusing on the GRN controlling digit specification. Using comparative ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq across embryonic limb buds from chicken, mouse, and alligator, we mapped the landscape of active cis-regulatory elements (CREs) for key transcription factors like HOXD13 and SOX9. While the protein-coding sequences and overall network topology are highly conserved, we identified thousands of species-specific CREs. Functional validation using in-vivo reporter assays in transgenic mice demonstrated that orthologous enhancers from different species drive distinct spatiotemporal expression patterns, correlating directly with divergent limb morphologies. Our results show that tinkering with the activity of modular CREs, rather than altering protein function or network structure, provides a powerful and flexible mechanism for generating morphological diversity, circumventing the constraints of pleiotropy.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Evolution of Morphological Novelty through Cis-Regulatory Divergence in Tetrapod Limb Development
"A central debate in macroevolution concerns the relative importance of deterministic, trait-dependent processes versus stochastic, neutral processes in shaping large-scale biodiversity patterns. We tested these competing hypotheses using a time-calibrated supertree of over 30,000 angiosperm species. We applied state-dependent speciation and extinction (SSE) models to assess the correlation between key innovations (e.g., floral symmetry, herbaceousness) and net diversification rates. While we found statistically significant associations for several traits, these models often performed no better than trait-independent models that account for rate heterogeneity across the phylogeny. Furthermore, simulations under pure-birth and birth-death models that incorporate random shifts in diversification rates could replicate the empirical phylogenetic patterns with high fidelity. Our findings challenge the prevailing adaptationist narrative by demonstrating that stochastic processes, independent of any specific phenotypic trait, are a sufficient and powerful explanation for the dramatic heterogeneity in diversification rates observed in major clades, highlighting the crucial role of contingency in macroevolution.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,The Dominance of Stochastic Processes in Macroevolutionary Diversification Patterns of Angiosperms
"Eusociality, characterized by reproductive division of labor, represents a major evolutionary transition. To uncover its molecular basis, we performed a comparative transcriptomic analysis of brain and ovarian tissues from queens and workers across ten independently evolved eusocial species of bees and wasps, alongside solitary relatives. Despite vast phylogenetic distances, we identified a conserved 'toolkit' of genes that were consistently differentially expressed between castes. These genes are primarily involved in metabolic processes, insulin signaling, oxidative stress response, and vitellogenin pathways, but notably, not novel 'social' genes. Phylogenetic analysis of promoter regions for these toolkit genes revealed convergent evolution of transcription factor binding sites. This suggests that the evolution of eusociality did not involve the origin of new genes, but rather the repeated co-option of a conserved set of ancestral pathways governing reproduction and physiology, rewired through convergent changes in gene regulation to establish distinct queen and worker phenotypes.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Convergent Regulatory Evolution Underpins the Independent Origins of Eusociality in Hymenoptera

We investigated the role of HGT in the evolution of metabolic novelty within hyperthermophilic archaea from deep-sea hydrothermal vent ecosystems. By constructing a comprehensive pan-genome from over 200 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), we employed phylogenetic incongruence and gene synteny analyses to identify HGT events. Our results reveal a massive and continuous influx of genetic material, with nearly 30% of the accessory genome in these archaea showing evidence of inter-domain HGT, primarily from thermophilic bacteria. These transferred genes are significantly enriched in functions related to novel catabolic pathways, including sulfur metabolism and hydrogen utilization, which correspond to the unique geochemistry of the vent environment.

Using phylogenetic comparative methods, we analyzed the evolutionary correlations between male call frequency, female auditory tuning (basilar papilla morphology), and spectral properties of skin coloration across 45 species. We found strong evidence for the sensory bias hypothesis: the evolution of male call dominant frequency was tightly coupled to, and likely preceded by, shifts in female auditory tuning. Behavioral experiments confirmed that female preference is strongest for calls matching their species-specific auditory sensitivity. Furthermore, signal efficacy experiments revealed that conspicuous coloration enhances signal detection in noisy environments, suggesting a multimodal interaction.

This allows the model to capture long-range dependencies and non-local interactions critical for heterophilic settings, where connected nodes often belong to different classes. Unlike conventional message-passing schemes that are inherently biased towards homophily, SpAN learns adaptive spectral filters to aggregate information from informative nodes regardless of their geodesic distance. The decoupling of propagation and aggregation mitigates the over-smoothing problem and provides a more expressive model class. We demonstrate empirically that SpAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on highly heterophilic benchmark datasets, including Cornell, Texas, and Chameleon, outperforming both spatial and spectral GNN baselines.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Decoupled Spectral Attention for Graph Neural Networks in Heterophilic Regimes

This is formulated as a variational inference problem over the space of control policies, which is solved efficiently using an auxiliary neural network. By optimizing the entire denoising path, LTO enables fine-grained control over semantic attributes and compositional generation that is unattainable with static guidance.

Our approach explicitly learns a latent Structural Causal Model (SCM) of the environment's dynamics by leveraging interventional data, either provided offline or gathered through an active learning protocol. This learned SCM allows the agent to perform counterfactual reasoning—simulating the effects of unseen perturbations—and adapt its policy without further environmental interaction.

Each client encrypts their local model update and provides a NIZK proof attesting that the update was computed legitimately from their local data and conforms to predefined constraints (e.g., norm bounds). The central server can efficiently verify these proofs in bulk before aggregating the encrypted updates, ensuring that only valid contributions influence the global model.

These representations are then processed by a symbolic module, which executes formal deductive operations based on a set of first-order logic rules or an external knowledge graph. The results of these symbolic operations are then projected back into the embedding space and used as context for subsequent token generation.

Hadam operates by parameterizing model weights on a Poincaré ball, a model of hyperbolic space with constant negative curvature. Gradient updates are performed using the Riemannian gradient, which naturally encourages smaller updates for parameters far from the origin, effectively regularizing the model. This geometric constraint guides the optimization trajectory towards wider valleys in the loss landscape. Furthermore, the hyperbolic geometry provides a natural mechanism for escaping saddle points.

CQE bridges this gap by applying the principles of split conformal prediction to the aggregated output of a quantile regression deep ensemble. The ensemble is trained to predict a range of conditional quantiles, and a separate calibration set is used to adjust these predicted intervals to achieve a user-specified marginal coverage level (e.g., 95%) with distribution-free guarantees. This post-hoc calibration corrects for model misspecification and dataset shift.

CIB aims to learn a minimal, sufficient representation of one modality (e.g., image) that is predictive of another (e.g., text), while simultaneously being maximally compressed. This compression forces the model to discard modality-specific, spurious correlations and retain only the shared semantic content. The contrastive component provides a powerful training signal for learning this compressed representation. We show that models pre-trained with CIB achieve state-of-the-art performance on downstream tasks like cross-modal retrieval and visual question answering, and qualitative analyses confirm the learned representations are significantly more disentangled than those from competing methods.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Contrastive Information Bottleneck for Disentangled Multimodal Representations

This duality allows us to unify these disparate lines of research into a single framework, SSD (State-Space Duality). Leveraging this framework, we develop a new hybrid architecture that combines the recurrent efficiency of SSMs for local context with the parallelizable global modeling of low-rank attention.

We construct a multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) that explicitly maps the causal structure of the dS bulk to the entanglement structure of the boundary state. The geometry of the MERA tensor connections is shown to quantitatively reproduce the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for entanglement entropy in the dS/CFT correspondence context, particularly for intervals near the future boundary. By analyzing the disentangling properties of the isometries within the network, we derive a holographic screen and demonstrate how information about bulk operators is localized on this screen. Our model provides a concrete framework for understanding how bulk locality and cosmology emerge from the quantum entanglement of a boundary theory, offering a new computational tool to investigate quantum gravity in non-Anti-de Sitter backgrounds and address the information paradox in cosmological horizons.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Kuantum,Generated,Holographic Entanglement Renormalization and Bulk Causal Structure in a De Sitter Spacetime
"The thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) establishes a fundamental trade-off between the precision of a thermodynamic current and its associated entropy production. While robust in classical stochastic systems, its validity in the quantum realm, particularly in the presence of coherence, remains contested. Here, we theoretically and experimentally investigate charge transport through a single, coherently-driven quantum dot coupled to two fermionic leads. Using a non-equilibrium Green's function approach, we predict that quantum coherence, induced by a resonant microwave field, can generate current fluctuations that fall below the classical TUR bound. Our experimental measurements of the shot noise and current, performed in a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure at millikelvin temperatures, confirm this violation. The degree of violation is directly correlated with the Rabi frequency of the driving field, demonstrating that quantum coherence acts as a resource for enhancing thermodynamic precision beyond classical limits.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Kuantum,Generated,Violation of the Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation in a Coherently Driven Quantum Dot System
"We investigate the ergodic-to-many-body localized (MBL) transition in a one-dimensional chain of interacting dipolar spins subject to a quasiperiodic potential. Using large-scale time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (tDMRG) simulations, we map out the complete phase diagram. Contrary to the sharp transition observed in models with random disorder, we identify an intermediate phase characterized by a many-body mobility edge. In this phase, high-energy eigenstates are thermal and obey the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), while low-energy states are localized. This leads to a distinct dynamic signature: following a global quench, the system exhibits a power-law growth of entanglement entropy at short times, followed by a slow, logarithmic increase that persists indefinitely, indicating non-ergodic behavior without full MBL. Our findings challenge the universality of the MBL transition and suggest that quasiperiodic systems offer a unique platform for realizing quantum systems with tunable ergodicity.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Kuantum,Generated,Logarithmic Entanglement Growth and Many-Body Mobility Edge in a Disordered Dipolar Spin Chain

The state's planar squeezing and optimized orientation in parameter space allow for the simultaneous reduction of quantum projection noise in multiple non-commuting observables. By applying a carefully timed sequence of radio-frequency pulses and measuring the collective spin projections, we extract the parameters from the correlated atomic response. We demonstrate a sustained 4.2 dB improvement over the SQL for all three parameters concurrently.

By driving the atoms with a transverse laser field, we induce a long-range, photon-mediated interaction that competes with the native short-range contact interaction. Above a critical pump power, the system undergoes a quantum phase transition from a superfluid to a super-solid phase, characterized by the spontaneous breaking of both U(1) gauge symmetry and continuous translational symmetry. We directly image the emergent crystalline density modulation via in-situ absorption imaging and confirm the persistence of phase coherence through time-of-flight interference measurements. The phase diagram is mapped by varying the pump laser detuning and atomic density, showing excellent agreement with theoretical predictions from an extended Bose-Hubbard model.

"The Unruh effect, predicting a thermal bath for a uniformly accelerated observer, is a cornerstone of quantum field theory in curved spacetime. However, realistic physical trajectories are never perfectly uniform. We present an exact calculation of the response function for a scalar Unruh-DeWitt detector undergoing a class of non-uniform accelerations, specifically a 'jerking' trajectory with a time-varying proper acceleration profile. Using worldline quantization techniques and mode-sum analysis, we demonstrate that the detector's excitation spectrum deviates significantly from a perfect Planckian distribution. We find non-thermal, coherence-driven features in the low-frequency regime and a modification of the effective Unruh temperature dependent on the jerk parameter. These corrections imply that the vacuum state appears non-thermal to a non-uniformly accelerated observer, a result with profound implications for the interpretation of Hawking radiation from evaporating black holes, which experience a changing surface gravity, and for proposed experimental verifications of the Unruh effect.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Kuantum,Generated,Non-Thermal Corrections to the Unruh Effect for a Trajectory with Non-Uniform Proper Acceleration

Our system uses a chain of 16 Ytterbium-171 ions, with all-to-all spin-spin interactions engineered via spin-dependent optical forces, mimicking the SYK model's random four-fermion coupling. Scrambling is quantified by measuring the squared commutator of initially localized, non-commuting operators, which is equivalent to an out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC). We observe an exponential growth of the OTOC at early times, characteristic of quantum chaos, from which we extract the quantum Lyapunov exponent. The measured exponent exhibits a linear dependence on temperature, saturating at a value approaching the 2πk_B T/ħ bound predicted by holographic duality for maximally chaotic systems.

This study extends previous work on scalar fields to the more physically relevant Dirac field in a (3+1)-dimensional flat Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime. We compute the concurrence for two detectors coupled to the Dirac vacuum and analyze its dependence on detector separation, energy gap, and the cosmological scale factor a(t). Our results show that entanglement harvesting is significantly suppressed during periods of rapid cosmic expansion compared to the inertial Minkowski case. Furthermore, the spin-statistics of the fermionic field introduces anti-correlations that inhibit entanglement extraction at certain distances where a scalar field would permit it. This analysis reveals how spacetime curvature and dynamics fundamentally constrain the accessible entanglement resources of the quantum vacuum, with implications for relativistic quantum information protocols in cosmological settings.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Kuantum,Generated,Entanglement Harvesting from the Dirac Field in a Cosmological FLRW Spacetime
"We introduce a novel, model-agnostic approach for identifying quantum phase transitions (QPTs) using techniques from topological data analysis (TDA). By treating the set of many-body ground state wavefunctions, sampled across the parameter space of the one-dimensional extended Bose-Hubbard model, as a point cloud, we compute its persistent homology. The resulting persistence diagrams, which encode the birth and death of topological features (connected components, loops, etc.) in the data, reveal distinct signatures at the known QPTs. The transition from the superfluid to the Mott insulator phase corresponds to a sudden change in the lifetime of zeroth-homology features, while the charge-density-wave transition is marked by the emergence of a persistent first-homology feature. This method, which requires no prior knowledge of order parameters, successfully identifies both symmetry-breaking and topological phase transitions.

Our method leverages persistent homology to construct homological scaffolds of input graphs, capturing multi-scale topological invariants such as cycles and voids. We formulate a hierarchical contrastive objective that maximizes mutual information between a GNN's node embeddings and these topological summaries at varying dimensionalities. This forces the model to learn representations that are not only locally informed but also sensitive to global topological structure.

We propose the Causal Disentangled VAE (CD-VAE), a framework that imposes a Structural Causal Model (SCM) on the latent space to achieve meaningful disentanglement. Our key contribution is a novel intervention-based regularization term derived from counterfactual queries. During training, the model is required to predict the outcome of hypothetical interventions on latent variables, penalizing deviations from the specified SCM. This counterfactual consistency objective forces the encoder to align latent dimensions with independent causal mechanisms. Experiments on synthetic datasets with known ground-truth causal graphs and real-world benchmarks like CelebA demonstrate that CD-VAE significantly outperforms existing methods in both disentanglement metrics and the ability to perform targeted, downstream interventions on generated data, paving the way for more controllable and interpretable generative models.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Causal Disentanglement in Variational Autoencoders via Counterfactual-Regularized Latent Spaces

We introduce a client-adaptive noise mechanism based on Gaussian-DP, calibrated via the moments accountant, which provides tight (ε, δ)-DP guarantees while minimizing the impact on model utility. The privacy budget is dynamically allocated based on client data contributions, ensuring equitable privacy-utility trade-offs.

Unlike static approaches, SGT dynamically infers a sparse, adaptive graph adjacency matrix at each time step, representing the evolving underlying system structure. This learned graph is then used within a graph convolutional network to propagate information, producing context-aware node embeddings. These embeddings are subsequently processed by a temporal transformer encoder that attends to both sequential patterns and the dynamically evolving graph topology. Evaluated on challenging benchmarks from traffic flow prediction, energy consumption, and financial markets, SGT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models.

Each agent's communication policy is optimized using the information bottleneck principle, which introduces a regularizer that minimizes the mutual information between an agent's observation and its transmitted message, while maximizing the mutual information between the message and its action-value function. This objective forces the emergence of a compressed, task-relevant symbolic language. We test our framework in cooperative navigation and resource allocation tasks with limited bandwidth. Results show that IB-Com agents develop more robust, interpretable, and decentralized policies.

First, we introduce a metaplasticity rule where the learning rate of each synapse is dynamically modulated by a local estimate of its importance for past tasks, effectively shielding consolidated knowledge. Second, to accommodate new information without interference, we employ Orthogonal Weight Consolidation. This projects the gradient updates for a new task onto a subspace that is orthogonal to the principal components of parameter spaces from previous tasks, minimizing representational overlap. This synergy between weight-specific stabilization and gradient-based interference mitigation allows for both knowledge retention and forward transfer.

The discriminator is trained on a dual objective: distinguishing generated fields from ground-truth data (if available) and penalizing violations of the governing PDEs by evaluating their residuals at randomly sampled collocation points. This adversarial training in both data and physics space regularizes the learning process, ensuring that the generated solutions are not only realistic but also physically consistent.

A policy network then learns to guide a differentiable forward-chaining reasoner, which executes multi-step logical inference over this symbolic knowledge base to derive provably correct action plans. The entire architecture is end-to-end trainable via policy gradients, with a reward function based on logical entailment of goal states.

Coalescent-based species tree methods and phylogenomic network analyses revealed significant cytonuclear discordance and extensive reticulation, particularly at the base of major clades. Our results indicate that rampant gene flow during the early stages of the radiation, rather than ILS alone, is the primary driver of topological incongruence.

Using time-series population genomics, we tracked allele frequency trajectories at resistance (R) and avirulence (Avr) loci over a decade. Our analysis revealed rapid, recurrent selective sweeps at nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) gene clusters in the host, countered by diversifying selection on secreted effector proteins in the pathogen. We observed strong signatures of negative frequency-dependent selection, consistent with Red Queen dynamics, where rare resistance alleles confer a transient advantage. Furthermore, we identified co-adapted genomic islands of high differentiation, suggesting that linked clusters of genes involved in defense and counter-defense co-evolve as supergenes, facilitating a rapid and coordinated response to parasitic challenges.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Antagonistic Coevolutionary Dynamics and the Genomic Architecture of Host-Parasite Arms Races

We conducted a comparative functional genomic study across four divergent arthropod lineages, using ATAC-seq to map chromatin accessibility around key limb-patterning transcription factors like Distal-less (Dll) and spalt (sal). Our results reveal deep conservation of the core gene regulatory network (GRN) architecture, but profound divergence in the activity and sequence of specific cis-regulatory elements (CREs). We demonstrate through reporter assays in a Drosophila model that orthologous enhancers from a myriapod drive distinct spatiotemporal expression patterns, directly contributing to altered limb segmentation.

We integrated long-read sequencing with population genetic modeling to reconstruct the evolutionary history and molecular mechanism of this driver. Our analysis resolved the complex structure of the t-haplotype, identifying four distinct distorter genes and a single responder locus whose interaction leads to sperm incapacitation. Phylogenetic analysis indicates the supergene originated over 1.5 million years ago and has since been locked in an evolutionary battle with unlinked suppressors in the genomic background. We demonstrate that the fitness cost associated with homozygous lethality and reduced male fertility creates a balanced polymorphism, with drive efficiency intricately modulated by the frequency of suppressors in natural populations.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,The Evolutionary Trajectory of a Selfish Supergene: Meiotic Drive and Genomic Conflict in Mus musculus domesticus

Our results reveal significant ancestral plasticity in these traits, with the direction of the plastic response often aligning with the direction of subsequent evolutionary divergence among ecomorphs. Using a comparative quantitative genetic framework, we found evidence for genetic accommodation, where initially plastic responses became canalized over evolutionary time. This process appears to unveil cryptic genetic variation, providing the raw material for selection to act upon.

Our analysis, using site-heterogeneous mixture models and coalescent-based methods, confidently resolves several contentious nodes, including the placement of turtles as sister to archosaurs and the monophyly of Afrotheria. Beyond resolving bifurcation patterns, our investigation uncovered strong signals of ancient reticulation. Specifically, we identified multiple instances of large-scale horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from non-metazoan sources into early vertebrate lineages, as well as evidence for a significant ancient hybridization event between the stem lineages of gnathostomes and cyclostomes.

Within 500 generations, all replicate populations evolved simple, undifferentiated multicellular clusters. Whole-genome sequencing of evolved clones revealed that the initial transition was consistently caused by mutations in genes controlling cell division and separation, often with pleiotropic effects on cell cycle regulation. These early multicellular forms exhibited significant life history trade-offs.

Using whole-genome resequencing of individuals from freshwater, brackish, and saline habitats, we identified a heterogeneous genomic landscape of differentiation. While most of the genome remained porous to gene flow, distinct 'genomic islands of divergence' were evident, enriched for genes involved in ion transport and osmoregulation. The size and number of these islands increased proportionally with the degree of reproductive isolation, and linkage disequilibrium was significantly higher within islands.

We demonstrate that while high relatedness facilitates the initial spread of altruistic alleles, stable eusociality requires strong between-group selection to overcome within-group conflict. Critically, our model incorporates genomic constraints, showing that mechanisms like genomic imprinting can bias offspring to become workers, resolving parent-offspring conflict over caste fate.

We trained the CCE model on a large corpus of Renaissance polyphony. Without any symbolic data or explicit music-theoretic labels, the learned embedding space exhibits a clear geometric structure corresponding to Fuxian principles.

From this representation, we extract a feature vector encoding note-level deviations from a notated metronomic grid. These features are then modeled using a Hierarchical Bayesian framework, which infers performer-specific agogic accent patterns while accounting for structural context (e.g., phrase boundaries, harmonic tension).

"The generation of musically coherent atonal compositions presents a unique challenge for statistical models. We introduce the Set-Class Variational Autoencoder (SC-VAE), a deep generative model designed to learn and synthesize novel musical material adhering to the principles of post-tonal pitch-class set theory. The model's latent space is regularized using a custom loss function that encourages clustering based on abstract set-theoretic properties, such as the interval-class vector and Forte number, rather than raw pitch proximity. The decoder, a Transformer-based architecture, learns to map points in this structured latent space to piano-roll representations. Trained on the serial and atonal works of the Second Viennese School, the SC-VAE demonstrates an ability to generate novel compositions that exhibit sophisticated structural properties, including transpositional and inversional invariance and consistent use of a source set-class vocabulary, far exceeding the coherence of standard VAE and GAN-based models.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Generative Modeling of Atonal Pitch Structures with a Set-Class-Constrained Variational Autoencoder
"This study introduces a cross-modal deep learning framework to investigate the alignment between musical structure and dramatic narrative in opera. We employ a dual-stream architecture: a recurrent segmentation network processes audio features (chromagrams, MFCCs) to perform unsupervised structural segmentation, identifying key changes and textural shifts. Concurrently, a pre-trained BERT model analyzes the libretto to extract time-aligned semantic vector representations and perform topic modeling. A cross-modal attention mechanism is then trained to learn a mapping between the musical segment embeddings and the semantic text embeddings. Applied to a corpus of Wagnerian music dramas, our system automatically identifies strong correlations between specific harmonic regions (e.g., leitmotif presentations, deceptive cadences) and dramaturgical events (e.g., character revelations, plot twists).

"The spectral overlap of instruments in orchestral music poses a significant challenge for automatic harmonic analysis. This paper proposes a theory-informed Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) approach to disentangle timbral and harmonic components. Our model, Constrained Harmonic-Timbral NMF (CHT-NMF), decomposes a magnitude spectrogram into two sets of basis vectors: a fixed dictionary of spectral templates learned from isolated instrument samples, and a set of harmonic basis vectors representing pitch-class content. The temporal activations of the harmonic bases are constrained by a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) whose transition probabilities are derived from a corpus-based model of functional harmony. By simultaneously optimizing the factorization and the HMM state sequence, CHT-NMF achieves superior performance in both chord recognition and instrument identification tasks on complex orchestral excerpts compared to standard NMF and deep learning source separation baselines. The framework effectively regularizes the ill-posed decomposition problem by injecting music-theoretic domain knowledge.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Müzik,Generated,Disentangling Timbre and Harmony in Orchestral Audio using Theory-Informed Non-Negative Matrix Factorization

The model's state space represents a multi-level metrical grid, tracking concurrent hypotheses for tactus, measure, and hypermeter periodicities. The observation model integrates acoustic evidence from an onset detection function, while the transition model incorporates musically-informed priors based on Lerdahl and Jackendoff's Metrical Preference Rules (MPRs), such as parallelism and stress alignment. We evaluate the model on a challenging dataset of music with metric ambiguity, including works by Stravinsky and American minimalism.

We employ a Gaussian Process classifier, fronted by a deep feature extractor pre-trained on a large music corpus, to model the probability that a musical fragment is perceived as tonally ambiguous. The active learning component uses an entropy-based query strategy to iteratively select the most informative stimuli to present to human subjects for labeling. This closed-loop system rapidly converges on the decision boundary separating stable and ambiguous tonal regions within a high-dimensional feature space derived from Krumhansl-Kessler key profiles and spiral array model coordinates.

"Epigenetic modifications are fundamental to cell identity, and their dysregulation underlies numerous pathologies. We developed a multiplexable CRISPR-based epigenetic editing platform using nuclease-deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) fused to catalytic domains of TET1 and DNMT3A to achieve targeted DNA demethylation and de novo methylation, respectively. By directing these editors to promoter and enhancer regions of key pluripotency factors, we demonstrate bidirectional control over local chromatin states and transcriptional output in human somatic cells. Simultaneous targeting of bivalent domains with dCas9-TET1 and dCas9-DNMT3A induced a stable epigenetic memory, recalibrating the H3K4me3/H3K27me3 balance. This targeted epigenetic perturbation efficiently modulated cellular reprogramming trajectories, enhancing the efficiency of induced pluripotent stem cell generation without genomic alteration.

"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical regulators of nuclear architecture and gene expression. Here, we identify CHROMA, a previously uncharacterized lncRNA that is essential for the silencing of a key developmental gene cluster. Using Chromatin Isolation by RNA Purification (ChIRP-seq) and Hi-C, we show that CHROMA acts as an architectural RNA, physically bridging distal regulatory elements. Mechanistically, CHROMA possesses intrinsically disordered regions that undergo liquid-liquid phase separation, forming biomolecular condensates that concentrate Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and the insulator protein CTCF. This process facilitates the formation of a repressive chromatin hub, effectively sequestering the gene cluster within a transcriptionally silent compartment. Depletion of CHROMA disrupts this higher-order structure, leading to decompaction of the locus, loss of H3K27me3 marks, and aberrant gene activation. Our results unveil a mechanism whereby a lncRNA leverages phase separation to dynamically organize genome topology and enforce epigenetic silencing.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,The lncRNA CHROMA Orchestrates Higher-Order Chromatin Looping via Phase Separation with PRC2 and CTCF

The FET family of RNA-binding proteins (FUS, EWS, TAF15) are implicated in this process, yet their direct role in assembling functional transcriptional condensates remains unclear. We demonstrate that the low-complexity domains of FET proteins are necessary and sufficient to drive LLPS in vitro and in vivo. Using high-resolution microscopy and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), we show these condensates are liquid-like and preferentially form at super-enhancers. These FET-driven compartments selectively concentrate RNA Polymerase II, the Mediator complex, and key coactivators like BRD4, thereby amplifying transcriptional output. Importantly, oncogenic FET fusion proteins exhibit altered phase behavior, leading to aberrant condensate formation and dysregulated expression of target genes.

By integrating these multi-modal data, we constructed a high-resolution map of hematopoietic development, resolving previously ambiguous lineage commitment points.

"The maintenance of genome integrity relies on the accurate repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) through competing pathways like non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR). The choice between these pathways is tightly regulated by post-translational modifications. We report that the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF168, a critical factor in DSB signaling, is dynamically modified by SUMO2/3. Using mass spectrometry, we identified a conserved SUMOylation site within RNF168's UIM domain. We demonstrate that SUMOylation of RNF168, mediated by the E3 ligase PIAS4, sterically hinders its interaction with the HR factor BRCA1, thereby promoting NHEJ. Conversely, de-SUMOylation by the SUMO protease SENP6 is required for efficient recruitment of BRCA1 to DSBs and subsequent HR initiation. Disruption of this SUMO-deSUMO cycle leads to genomic instability and hypersensitivity to PARP inhibitors, revealing a novel regulatory switch that fine-tunes DNA repair pathway choice with significant therapeutic implications.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Dynamic SUMOylation of the RNF168 Ubiquitin Ligase Regulates DNA Double-Strand Break Repair Pathway Choice

The structure reveals the receptor in a G protein-uncoupled conformation, with the intracellular loop 3 and transmembrane helix 6 adopting a distinct, arrestin-compatible state. The phosphorylated C-terminal tail of the receptor snakes through a positively charged groove in the N-lobe of β-arrestin, while the arrestin 'finger loop' inserts deep into the receptor's transmembrane core, a key interaction for stabilization.

Using ribosome profiling and mRNA half-life measurements in S. cerevisiae, we demonstrate that codon optimality directly dictates mRNA stability through a co-translational decay mechanism. We show that ribosomes stalling at clusters of non-optimal codons recruit the DEAD-box helicase Dhh1 (the human ortholog of DDX6). Dhh1, in turn, promotes the association of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex, triggering rapid deadenylation and subsequent 5'-to-3' exonucleolytic decay. Site-directed mutagenesis of codon clusters or depletion of Dhh1 uncouples translation elongation speed from mRNA turnover. This pathway represents a critical quality control mechanism that fine-tunes protein expression levels and ensures the rapid removal of potentially problematic transcripts, thereby safeguarding proteome homeostasis.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Codon-Mediated Co-translational mRNA Decay is Regulated by Ribosome Stalling and the DEAD-box Helicase Dhh1

Through a systematic bioinformatic and proteomic screen, we identified HNL7, a 21-amino-acid peptide encoded within the 16S rRNA locus. We demonstrate that HNL7 is actively translated and secreted from metabolically stressed cells. Functionally, secreted HNL7 acts as a paracrine signaling molecule, binding with high affinity to the formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) on macrophages. Engagement of FPR2 by HNL7 triggers a signaling cascade that potently suppresses NF-κB activation and promotes a phenotypic switch from a pro-inflammatory M1 to an anti-inflammatory M2 polarization state. In vivo, administration of HNL7 ameliorates inflammatory tissue damage in a murine model of sepsis.

"Translational control provides a rapid mechanism for cells to adapt to stress.

Our analysis revealed a profound reprogramming of the translatome, characterized by a widespread increase in translation initiation at upstream open reading frames (uORFs) within the 5' UTRs of hundreds of mRNAs. For canonical ER stress response genes, such as ATF4, this uORF-mediated repression is bypassed under stress due to eIF2α phosphorylation, allowing robust synthesis of the main protein. However, we discovered a new class of genes where stress-induced uORF translation serves as a dominant repressive mechanism to downregulate proteins involved in cell growth and proliferation. This global atlas of TISs uncovers a pervasive logic of translational control orchestrated by uORFs, which acts as a critical regulatory layer in the integrated stress response.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Global Mapping of Translation Initiation Sites by Ribo-seq Reveals Widespread uORF-Mediated Translational Control in Response to ER Stress
"Cellular senescence is a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest implicated in aging and age-related diseases. While epigenetic dysregulation is a hallmark of senescence, the downstream consequences are poorly defined. We report that the progressive loss of epigenetic silencing in senescent cells leads to the transcriptional activation of long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1) retrotransposons. The resulting LINE-1 transcripts are reverse-transcribed in the cytoplasm, generating immunogenic DNA:RNA hybrids and extrachromosomal dsDNA. These nucleic acids are sensed by the pattern recognition receptor cGAS, which activates the STING pathway, leading to the production of type I interferons and other pro-inflammatory cytokines characteristic of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Pharmacological inhibition of LINE-1 reverse transcriptase or genetic ablation of cGAS or STING significantly attenuates the SASP and delays the onset of senescence-related pathologies, linking retrotransposon activity directly to sterile inflammation in aging.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,LINE-1 Retrotransposon Activation Triggers a cGAS-STING-Dependent Inflammatory Cascade Driving Cellular Senescence

Using a combination of the delta-system method, randomized shifting operations, and spectral techniques, we establish a sharp upper bound on the Turán density for several classes of t-avoidant hypergraphs. Our main theorem resolves a conjecture by Frankl and Füredi for large n, demonstrating that the extremal construction is either a sunflower or a complete subgraph.

We prove that these inequalities are facet-defining for the ATSP polytope under mild coprimality conditions on the braid parameters. A key contribution is a polynomial-time separation algorithm for a significant subclass of these inequalities, based on a minimum-cut computation in an auxiliary network.

Our experiment utilizes a high-Q silicon torsional micro-resonator to achieve sub-piconewton force sensitivity at separation distances ranging from 100 nm to 2 µm. The non-trivial boundary geometry introduces a significant, calculable deviation from the PFA prediction, which we analyze using a scattering matrix formalism that accounts for the exact Green's functions of the electromagnetic field. We find that the measured force is in excellent agreement (within 0.5%) with the exact theory, while deviating from the PFA by up to 15% at separations comparable to the corrugation wavelength.

"Lactate, traditionally viewed as a metabolic byproduct, is emerging as a crucial signaling molecule in the brain. Here, we investigate the role of histone lysine lactylation (Kla), a novel epigenetic modification, in neuronal plasticity. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and quantitative proteomics in primary hippocampal neurons, we demonstrate that neuronal activity induces a rapid and transient increase in H3K18la at the enhancers and promoters of immediate early genes (IEGs), including c-Fos and Arc. This process is contingent upon lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA)-mediated lactate production. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of this pathway abrogates long-term potentiation (LTP) and impairs spatial memory formation in mice.

"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are key regulators of nuclear architecture, often functioning within ribonucleoprotein (RNP) condensates. The paraspeckle, a subnuclear body formed around the lncRNA NEAT1, is a paradigm for such structures. We investigated the role of another abundant lncRNA, MALAT1, in modulating paraspeckle dynamics. Using super-resolution microscopy and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), we show that MALAT1 transiently localizes to the paraspeckle periphery, altering its liquid-like properties and reducing the exchange rate of core protein components like NONO and SFPQ. In vitro reconstitution assays demonstrate that MALAT1, through specific RNA-protein and RNA-RNA interactions, lowers the saturation concentration required for NEAT1-driven liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and increases the viscosity of the resulting condensates. Depletion of MALAT1 leads to hyper-assembly of paraspeckles and altered retention of target mRNAs, suggesting MALAT1 functions as a dynamic rheostat for RNP granule homeostasis.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,The lncRNA MALAT1 Acts as a Molecular Scaffold to Modulate the Material Properties of Paraspeckles via Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation

Cryo-EM reconstruction of the human RNF185-TMX1 heterodimer revealed a unique architecture where the TMX1 redox-active site is positioned to engage substrates, while the RNF185 RING domain recruits E2 conjugating enzymes. Functional assays demonstrate that this complex specifically targets N-glycosylated proteins recognized by the lectin OS-9, facilitating their retro-translocation via the Derlin-1 channel.

Our real-time trajectories reveal that BLM engages the G4 structure and utilizes an iterative, ATP-dependent translocation mechanism characterized by repetitive one-to-three base-pair steps. We observed frequent pausing and backtracking, indicating a stochastic 'trial-and-error' process before successful G4 unfolding. Mutation of the RQC domain disrupts this iterative process, leading to persistent stalling and incomplete resolution.

We identified a distinct m6A landscape characterized by hypermethylation of transcripts associated with the cell cycle. Strikingly, m6A deposition within intronic regions near splice sites correlated with exon skipping events in a cohort of proto-oncogenes. We demonstrate that the m6A reader YTHDC1 preferentially binds to these methylated introns, recruiting the splicing factor SRSF3 and thereby repelling the core spliceosome machinery. Genetic depletion of the m6A writer METTL3 reverses these splicing patterns and attenuates tumor growth in xenograft models.

"Cellular adaptation to metabolic stress involves complex interplay between signaling pathways.

We employed a systems-level approach, integrating quantitative proteomics and untargeted metabolomics, to profile hepatic cells subjected to palmitate-induced ER stress. The analysis revealed a significant rewiring of cellular metabolism and identified the PERK-eIF2α-ATF4 branch of the UPR as the central hub. We demonstrate that ATF4 directly transcriptionally upregulates a suite of autophagy-related genes, including MAP1LC3B and SQSTM1, thereby promoting autophagic flux to clear lipid droplets and damaged organelles (lipophagy). Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of PERK abrogates this adaptive autophagic response, leading to exacerbated steatosis and apoptosis.

As a corollary, we provide a combinatorial interpretation for the plethystic decomposition of the Frobenius character of certain graded representations of the symmetric group S_n.

We determine the maximum size of such families for n > n_0(k, r, s), establishing a sharp threshold. Our proof integrates the Katona circle method with a refined algebraic shifting technique, allowing for precise control over the shadow of the family. A key innovation is the application of the Delta-system method in a probabilistic setting to handle the combinatorial complexity for small intersection sizes.

We establish precise asymptotic results for the spectral gap of the normalized Laplacian matrix, showing it scales inversely with a polynomial of the vertex count, with the exponent depending on the power-law parameter. This demonstrates the onset of anomalous diffusion, where the mixing time of the random walk deviates significantly from the O(log n) behavior seen in Erdős-Rényi graphs.

This framework generalizes recent breakthroughs on the log-concavity of the characteristic polynomial of a matroid, a conjecture by Rota. A key technical lemma involves demonstrating that the basis generating polynomial of a restricted minor of M maintains real-rootedness under certain operations, which is proven using the theory of strongly log-concave sequences and operator theory.

Singularity analysis of the resulting algebraic expression for the perimeter generating function P(z) = F(1, 1, z) allows us to extract the dominant asymptotic term. We prove that the number of such polygons is asymptotically c * n^(-5/2) * μ^n, where μ is an algebraic constant.

"Dysfunctional mitochondria are potent triggers of sterile inflammation, but the mechanisms that prevent their aberrant activation of the innate immune system are not fully understood. Here, we elucidate the critical role of selective autophagy of mitochondria (mitophagy) in restraining the NLRP3 inflammasome. Using high-content imaging and biochemical assays in primary macrophages, we show that mitochondrial damage induces a PINK1-dependent recruitment of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin, which ubiquitinates outer mitochondrial membrane proteins to tag the organelle for autophagic clearance. Genetic ablation of PINK1 or Parkin leads to the accumulation of damaged, ROS-generating mitochondria. This excess mitochondrial ROS (mROS) triggers the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, resulting in the release of oxidized mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) into the cytosol. This cytosolic mtDNA is then sensed by the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to caspase-1 activation and robust IL-1β secretion.

These siRNAs are loaded into the germline-specific Argonaute protein HRDE-1, which is essential for transmitting the epigenetic memory.

This TPP1-DNA interaction allosterically enhances POT1's affinity for DNA and positions the 5' end of the telomeric sequence for processive binding by POT1's tandem OB-folds. Mutating the TPP1-DNA interface abrogates this cooperative binding, destabilizes shelterin at telomeres, and elicits a potent ATR-dependent DNA damage response in human cells.

Here, we investigate the Polycomb Repressive Deubiquitinase (PRD) complex, containing the demethylase KDM6B and the deubiquitinase BAP1, during in vitro differentiation of human neural stem cells. Using time-resolved ChIP-seq and single-cell ATAC-seq, we demonstrate that PRD is dynamically recruited to key neurogenic loci, including PAX6 and NEUROD1, preceding transcriptional activation. We show that BAP1-mediated deubiquitination of H2AK119ub is a prerequisite for KDM6B to efficiently access and demethylate H3K27me3. Disruption of the PRD complex via CRISPR-mediated knockout of BAP1 results in stalled differentiation, retention of repressive histone marks at enhancer regions, and failure to establish an accessible chromatin landscape permissive for neuronal gene expression, thus defining PRD as a critical orchestrator of epigenetic reprogramming in neurogenesis.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Spatio-temporal Dynamics of H3K27me3 Demethylation by the Polycomb Repressive Deubiquitinase Complex during Neuronal Differentiation
"The therapeutic potential of CRISPR-based gene editing is hampered by challenges in correcting multiple, distinct pathogenic mutations simultaneously without inducing double-strand breaks (DSBs). We engineered a dual-deaminase orthogonal base editing platform comprising a cytidine base editor (CBE) driven by Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 and an adenosine base editor (ABE) fused to a smaller, distinct Cas12a ortholog. By designing specific protospacer adjacent motifs and guide RNAs, we achieved concurrent C•G-to-T•A and A•T-to-G•C conversions at independent genomic loci with minimal crosstalk. We applied this system to an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) model of a complex genetic disorder, simultaneously correcting a nonsense mutation and a missense SNP on different alleles. Deep sequencing and unbiased whole-genome analysis confirmed high on-target editing efficiency (>60%) and a DSB-independent mechanism that yielded negligible off-target mutations or structural variants.

"Nuclear speckles are dynamic, non-membranous organelles that function as hubs for pre-mRNA splicing factor storage and assembly. The architectural principles governing their formation remain elusive. Here, we elucidate the central role of the long non-coding RNA MALAT1 as a molecular scaffold for nuclear speckle integrity via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Using super-resolution microscopy and in vitro reconstitution assays, we demonstrate that multivalent interactions between MALAT1’s conserved triple-helix structure and serine/arginine-rich (SR) splicing factors drive the formation of biomolecular condensates. Targeted degradation of MALAT1 in living cells leads to rapid dissolution of nuclear speckles and mislocalization of core spliceosomal components like SRSF1 and U2AF65. Furthermore, CLIP-seq analysis reveals that MALAT1 directly binds to SR proteins, facilitating their recruitment and concentration.

"Ubiquitination is a versatile post-translational modification where distinct ubiquitin chain topologies dictate different cellular fates. While K48-linked polyubiquitination is the canonical signal for proteasomal degradation, the function of non-degradative K63-linked chains in the unfolded protein response (UPR) is less understood. We developed a novel mass spectrometry-based proteomic method, termed Ub-Topology Interrogation by Parallel Reaction Monitoring (Ub-TIP), to globally quantify K48- and K63-linked substrates during tunicamycin-induced ER stress. Our data reveal a temporal cascade where an initial, widespread wave of K63 ubiquitination on ER-resident chaperones and folding enzymes precedes the subsequent K48-mediated targeting of terminally misfolded proteins to the proteasome. Inhibition of the E3 ligase Hrd1 abrogated K48 linkage formation but surprisingly augmented K63 chains on substrate-receptor complexes, suggesting K63 chains function as a quality control checkpoint.

"Human telomerase, a specialized reverse transcriptase, maintains genome integrity by elongating chromosome ends. Its activity is tightly regulated by the shelterin complex, yet the structural basis for this interaction remains unclear. We report the 3.2 Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) structure of the human telomerase holoenzyme (hTERT and hTR) bound to the TEL-patch domain of the shelterin protein TPP1. The structure reveals that TPP1 docks onto a composite surface formed by the TERT TEN domain and the hTR Ku-binding loop, positioned distally from the enzyme's active site. This interaction induces a significant conformational change in the hTERT RID1/RID2 domains, reconfiguring their interface with the RNA template and promoting translocation fidelity after nucleotide addition. Functional assays with structure-guided mutations confirm that this TPP1-induced allosteric switch is essential for telomerase processivity but not for its catalytic activity per se.

"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant internal modification on eukaryotic mRNA, yet its role in the nervous system is just emerging. We investigated the function of m6A in synaptic plasticity, a cellular correlate of learning and memory. Using conditional knockout mice and neuron-specific AAV-mediated shRNA, we show that the m6A writer enzyme METTL3 is indispensable for long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus. m6A-sequencing combined with synaptoneurosome fractionation identified a cohort of plasticity-related mRNAs, including CaMKIIα and BDNF, that are heavily methylated in their 3' UTRs in a stimulus-dependent manner. Mechanistically, METTL3-deposited m6A is recognized by the reader protein YTHDF1, which recruits the translation initiation factor eIF3 to promote localized protein synthesis in active dendritic spines. Abolishing m6A deposition prevents this local translation surge and impairs the structural spine remodeling associated with LTP.

"The repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) presents a formidable challenge to genome stability, requiring coordination between DNA replication and repair machineries. The Fanconi Anemia protein FANCM, an ATP-dependent DNA translocase, is a key early responder at ICLs. Its precise molecular function at stalled replication forks, however, has been inferred primarily from bulk biochemical assays. Here, we use DNA combing and in vitro single-molecule imaging on Xenopus egg extracts to directly visualize FANCM's activity. We demonstrate that upon encountering an ICL, FANCM is rapidly recruited and utilizes its translocase activity to remodel the stalled fork into a four-way junction, a process known as fork reversal. Subsequently, FANCM remains bound to the reversed fork's junction, preventing its nucleolytic degradation by DNA2 and EXO1. This protective function is ATP-hydrolysis independent and crucial for providing a stable substrate for downstream repair factors. Our study provides direct visual evidence for FANCM's dual role in ICL repair: active fork remodeling followed by passive junction stabilization.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Single-Molecule Visualization of Fork Reversal and Protection by the FANCM Translocase at Interstrand Crosslink-Induced Stalled Replication Forks
"Circadian rhythms are driven by a transcriptional-translational feedback loop, but the contribution of translational control to setting the clock's ~24-hour period is poorly defined. We performed time-series ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) in synchronized mouse liver cells to map translational dynamics across the circadian cycle. Our analysis revealed pronounced, periodic ribosomal pausing at specific codon pairs within the coding sequences of core clock genes, most notably PER2 and CRY1. This pausing, which correlated with the nadir of the cognate tRNA's abundance, significantly slowed the elongation rate, creating a built-in delay between transcription and protein accumulation. Experimental manipulation of tRNA levels using anticodon-edited tRNAs either shortened or lengthened the circadian period, confirming a causal link. This codon-mediated translational pacing acts as a critical post-transcriptional timing mechanism, insulating the core oscillator from transcriptional noise and ensuring a robust, ~24-hour periodicity. Our findings highlight codon optimality as a fundamental and previously unappreciated regulatory layer in the mammalian circadian clock.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Ribosome-profiling Reveals Codon-specific Translational Pausing as a Key Regulatory Node in Circadian Clock Gene Expression
"Cells harboring a mixture of wild-type and mutated mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), a state known as heteroplasmy, exhibit variable disease penetrance. The mechanisms governing the selective elimination of mutant mtDNA are crucial for cellular health. We investigated this process in cybrid cell lines carrying the m.8993T>G pathogenic mutation, which impairs ATP synthase function. We demonstrate that the resulting decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) triggers oligomerization of the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) on the outer mitochondrial membrane. This VDAC oligomer serves as a scaffold for the recruitment and activation of the PINK1/Parkin mitophagy pathway, independent of canonical PINK1 stabilization. Using single-cell allele-quantification PCR and live-cell imaging, we tracked a progressive, mitophagy-dependent reduction in the proportion of mutant mtDNA over time. Pharmacological inhibition of VDAC oligomerization or genetic ablation of Parkin prevented this heteroplasmic shift. This VDAC-mediated surveillance provides a direct link between mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction and selective organellar clearance, representing a key cellular defense against pathogenic mtDNA.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Heteroplasmic Shift of Pathogenic mtDNA Variants Driven by VDAC-dependent Mitophagy Selectively Eliminates Defective Mitochondria
"The development of endocrine resistance is a major clinical obstacle in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer. To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we performed an integrative analysis of ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq (for FOXA1, H3K27ac), and RNA-seq data from patient-derived xenograft models of acquired tamoxifen resistance. Our computational modeling of the resulting gene regulatory networks identified the pioneer transcription factor FOXA1 as a master regulator of the resistant phenotype. In resistant cells, FOXA1 is redeployed to a distinct set of genomic loci, where it establishes de novo enhancers, characterized by increased chromatin accessibility and H3K27ac deposition. These reprogrammed enhancers drive the expression of a pro-survival, ER-independent transcriptional program, including key effectors like BCL2 and IGF1R. Critically, genetic silencing of FOXA1 in resistant cells led to a collapse of this newly established enhancer landscape and partially restored tamoxifen sensitivity. This study reveals FOXA1-mediated enhancer reprogramming as a core mechanism of endocrine resistance, offering a potential therapeutic vulnerability.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Integrative Multi-omics Analysis Deciphers a Core Transcriptional Regulatory Circuit Governed by Pioneer Factor FOXA1 in Endocrine-Resistant Breast Cancer

By inducing a ν=5/2 fractional quantum Hall state via a perpendicular magnetic field, we show that the system's low-energy excitations are described by Ising anyons, specifically Majorana zero modes localized at defect sites. Utilizing a tight-binding model combined with a configuration interaction approach, we calculate the non-unitary braiding matrices (B-matrices) for a four-anyon system. Our results explicitly show the non-commutativity of braiding operators, a hallmark of non-Abelian statistics, and demonstrate robustness against moderate levels of quenched disorder and thermal fluctuations. This work provides a concrete blueprint for a topologically protected quantum computational gate, leveraging the unique electronic properties of graphene to realize fault-tolerant qubit operations.

By interpreting the tensor network geometry as a discrete representation of a spatial slice of the bulk, we demonstrate that the D-MERA naturally accommodates the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for entanglement entropy. Applying our formalism to a 2D CFT undergoing a quantum quench, we numerically reconstruct the corresponding bulk geometry, revealing the formation of a causal horizon and a time-dependent geodesic structure consistent with Vaidya spacetime.

The protocol utilizes a cascaded sequence of Kerr nonlinearities and beam splitters to generate a highly non-Gaussian, multi-mode quantum state with strong inter-modal correlations. We derive the quantum Cramér-Rao bound for this system, demonstrating that the phase sensitivity scales as N^(-k), where N is the total mean photon number and k > 1, surpassing the standard Heisenberg scaling of N^(-1). Our theoretical analysis, supported by Wigner function-based numerical simulations, shows that the scheme is robust against moderate photon loss and detection inefficiency. This super-Heisenberg scaling arises from the specific non-linear correlations encoded in the multi-mode state. The proposed interferometric setup presents a viable pathway for next-generation gravitational wave detectors and atomic clocks, pushing precision measurements into a new quantum-dominated regime.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Kuantum,Generated,Quantum-Enhanced Phase Estimation via Multi-Mode Squeezed Coherent States

Using large-scale time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (t-DMRG) simulations, we explore the transition from an ergodic thermal phase to a non-ergodic MBL phase. Our central finding is the observation of a distinct dynamical signature: in the MBL regime, an initial local quantum quench leads to a slow, logarithmic growth of entanglement entropy, in stark contrast to the linear growth characteristic of thermalizing systems. We construct an effective Hamiltonian using a Floquet-Magnus expansion and identify the emergence of quasi-local integrals of motion (l-bits) that are responsible for the system's memory of its initial state.

We introduce a fully solvable model consisting of a central spin-1/2 system coupled anisotropically to a non-Markovian spin-bath environment. By exactly calculating the time evolution of the system-environment state, we quantify the proliferation of information by computing the quantum mutual information between the central system and progressively larger fractions of the environment. Our results demonstrate the formation of a 'redundancy plateau', where the mutual information saturates at the system's classical Shannon entropy value long before the entire environment is considered. This signifies the creation of multiple independent copies of the system's pointer-state information within the bath, rendering it objectively accessible.

The analysis reveals that the fidelity decays as a function of Rob's acceleration 'a', approaching the classical threshold of 2/3 at finite acceleration, unlike the scalar field case which requires infinite acceleration.

"Standard Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are limited by the expressive power of the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) test, confining their message-passing mechanism to pairwise interactions. To capture higher-order relationships inherent in complex systems, we propose Simplicial Complex Neural Networks (SCNNs). Our model operates on simplicial complexes, which generalize graphs to include multi-way relationships (e.g., triangles, tetrahedra). SCNNs employ a novel message-passing scheme across adjacent simplices of varying dimensions, guided by the Hodge Laplacian operator. This allows the model to learn representations that are sensitive to the underlying homological features of the data, such as cycles and cavities. We provide a theoretical analysis of SCNN's expressive power, showing its ability to distinguish topological structures that are indistinguishable to standard GNNs. On benchmarks for molecular property prediction and co-authorship network analysis, SCNNs demonstrate superior performance by effectively leveraging these higher-order relational inductive biases.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Higher-Order Graph Neural Networks for Capturing Simplicial Complex Topologies and Relational Inductive Biases
"Solving complex cooperative tasks in multi-agent systems is challenged by credit assignment and effective coordination. We propose Counterfactual Communication for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (CC-MARL), a novel framework that integrates counterfactual reasoning with a learnable communication protocol. Operating under the paradigm of centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE), our approach enables each agent to reason about its marginal contribution to the global reward by comparing the current team performance with a counterfactual baseline where its action is marginalized out. Concurrently, agents learn a low-bandwidth, differentiable communication protocol to share salient information from their local observations, dynamically shaping the multi-agent value function. This synergy allows for robust credit assignment even with sparse global rewards. We demonstrate in challenging coordination domains, such as StarCraft II micromanagement and multi-robot warehouse commissioning, that CC-MARL fosters sophisticated emergent strategies and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MARL algorithms like QMIX and COMA in zero-shot coordination scenarios.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Counterfactual Credit Assignment and Emergent Communication Protocols
"Existing knowledge graph completion (KGC) methods struggle with n-ary relations and generalizing to unseen entities, often relying on dense, entity-specific embeddings. We reframe KGC as a text-based, zero-shot inference problem addressed by pre-trained language models (PLMs). We introduce Hyper-Relational Contrastive Learning (HRCL), a self-supervised objective for fine-tuning PLMs on complex relational structures. Instead of predicting a single missing entity, HRCL trains the model to distinguish true hyper-relational facts (e.g., `(quarterback, Tom Brady, played_for, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, during, 2020-2021)`) from a set of hard negative samples generated by corrupting multiple fact components simultaneously. This forces the PLM to learn a deeper compositional understanding of relational semantics. By encoding facts as natural language prompts, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot KGC benchmarks like WikiPeople and JF17K, demonstrating a remarkable ability to complete complex, unseen relational instances without any direct supervision.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Hyper-Relational Contrastive Learning for Zero-Shot Knowledge Graph Completion with Pre-trained Language Models
"Accurate uncertainty quantification is critical for decision-making in complex systems, yet traditional deep learning models often produce uncalibrated probabilistic forecasts. We present Conformalized Quantile Regression Forests (CQRF), a non-parametric method that generates well-calibrated prediction intervals with finite-sample marginal coverage guarantees. Our approach leverages the predictive power of quantile regression forests to estimate conditional quantiles and then applies a split conformal prediction framework to adjust these quantiles, ensuring rigorous distribution-free coverage. This two-stage process effectively decouples the estimation of aleatoric uncertainty (via quantile regression) from the correction for epistemic uncertainty and model misspecification (via conformalization). We evaluate CQRF on challenging high-dimensional spatiotemporal forecasting tasks, including weather prediction and energy load forecasting, where data exhibit non-stationarity and complex dependencies. The results show that our method consistently produces tighter, more reliable prediction intervals than Bayesian neural networks and other deep probabilistic models.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Conformalized Quantile Regression Forests for Calibrated Probabilistic Forecasting in High-Dimensional Spatiotemporal Systems
"The quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism in Transformers remains a significant bottleneck for processing long sequences. We propose the Sparse Kernelized Attention (SKA) mechanism, a novel architecture that reduces the computational and memory complexity to linear time with respect to sequence length. SKA achieves this by combining two key innovations: first, a sparse, factorized attention pattern that approximates the dense attention matrix through a low-rank decomposition, focusing computational resources on salient tokens; second, a kernelized positional encoding scheme that replaces absolute or relative position embeddings with a continuous, translation-invariant kernel function. This allows the model to capture positional information implicitly within the attention calculation, improving generalization to sequence lengths unseen during training. We demonstrate that SKA-equipped Transformers match the performance of state-of-the-art models on long-document classification and autoregressive generation tasks while achieving up to a 10x speedup in inference.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Sparse Factorized Attention with Kernelized Positional Encodings for Linear-Time Transformer Inference
"Few-shot learning algorithms aim to adapt to new tasks using minimal data. We propose Bayesian Manifold Meta-Learning (BMML), a novel framework that learns a low-dimensional latent manifold of tasks. During meta-training, our approach, built upon an amortized variational inference framework, embeds entire tasks into this manifold, where proximity reflects task similarity. For a new few-shot task, we infer its posterior distribution on the manifold and generate task-specific model parameters by interpolating the parameters of neighboring tasks along geodesic paths. This Bayesian formulation naturally quantifies epistemic uncertainty about the new task's location, enabling more robust adaptation. Unlike optimization-based meta-learners like MAML, BMML performs adaptation via a single forward pass, making it significantly faster at test time. We demonstrate superior performance on challenging few-shot benchmarks, particularly in cross-domain and out-of-distribution scenarios, showcasing the enhanced generalization capabilities of our manifold-based approach.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Task-Agnostic Manifold Interpolation for Rapid Few-Shot Adaptation via Bayesian Meta-Learning
"Adversarial training is an effective empirical defense against adversarial examples, but it typically lacks formal robustness guarantees. Conversely, randomized smoothing provides certified robustness but often at the cost of significantly reduced standard accuracy. We introduce Latent Space Smoothed Training (LSST), a method that bridges this gap by applying the smoothing procedure in a learned latent space rather than the high-dimensional input space. LSST employs a denoising autoencoder to project inputs onto a lower-dimensional manifold where perturbations have a more semantically meaningful effect. Adversarial training is then performed on this smoothed latent representation. This approach allows us to derive a certified robustness guarantee in the input space, which is tied to the Lipschitz constant of the decoder network. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet show that LSST achieves certified robustness competitive with state-of-the-art smoothing techniques while largely preserving the high standard accuracy characteristic of adversarially trained models.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Adversarial Training with Certified Robustness via Randomized Smoothing over Latent Representations
"Bridging the gap between sub-symbolic perception and symbolic reasoning is a central challenge in AI. We propose a Differentiable Inductive Logic Programming (∂ILP) framework that learns symbolic rules from perceptual data. Our model consists of two tightly integrated components: a neural perception module that grounds abstract concepts into vector representations from raw inputs, and a differentiable ILP module that performs forward-chaining deduction over a tensorized knowledge base. By formulating the ILP deduction process using continuous relaxations of logical operators (e.g., AND, OR), we enable end-to-end training with gradient-based optimization. This allows the system to simultaneously learn perceptual representations and induce explicit, interpretable first-order logic rules that explain the data. We demonstrate our framework's ability to solve complex visual reasoning and relational learning tasks, achieving superior compositional generalization compared to purely neural or symbolic approaches and inducing human-readable logical theories from noisy inputs.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Integrating Inductive Logic Programming with Gradient-Based Optimization for Neuro-Symbolic Concept Learning

We introduce a novel Byzantine-robust aggregation protocol, FedRGM, which operates directly on the Riemannian manifold of model parameters. Our method computes the geometric median of local model updates, a provably robust estimator of central tendency, using a computationally efficient Weiszfeld-type algorithm adapted for manifolds. We provide theoretical guarantees on the breakdown point and convergence under heterogeneous data distributions. Empirically, we demonstrate on several benchmark vision and language tasks that FedRGM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art aggregation rules like Krum and Trimmed Mean in resisting sophisticated label-flipping and Gaussian noise attacks, while maintaining high model utility and communication efficiency in a fully decentralized topology.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Decentralized Federated Learning with Byzantine-Robust Gradient Aggregation via Geometric Median on Riemannian Manifolds
"Standard Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) excel at synthesizing photorealistic images but lack mechanisms for semantically meaningful, controllable manipulation. We propose the Causal-Aware GAN (CA-GAN), a framework that integrates a Structural Causal Model (SCM) into the latent space to enable counterfactual image generation. By modeling the causal relationships between latent factors of variation, our model can perform interventions (`do`-operations) to generate samples under specific causal conditions. Furthermore, it can synthesize counterfactuals by answering queries of the form 'what would image X have looked like if attribute A had been a', a task beyond the capability of correlation-based models. We employ an identifiable VAE pre-training phase to align latent variables with causal factors and a graph-based adversarial loss to enforce the SCM structure. We demonstrate that CA-GAN generates high-fidelity, disentangled counterfactuals on CelebA-HQ and Synapse-MRI datasets, facilitating applications in data augmentation, fairness analysis, and explainable AI.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Causal-Aware Generative Adversarial Networks for Counterfactual Image Synthesis

Our approach formulates network pruning as a bilevel optimization problem where a hypernetwork learns to generate pruning masks by optimizing for post-adaptation performance on a distribution of tasks. This differentiable process allows for gradient-based optimization of the pruning strategy itself, bypassing expensive black-box searches. The hypernetwork conditions its output on task embeddings, enabling few-shot adaptation to new, unseen tasks by generating bespoke sparse architectures. Experiments on Omniglot and mini-ImageNet demonstrate that MetaPrune discovers highly compressed models that achieve competitive accuracy with significantly fewer parameters and FLOPs compared to dense fine-tuning and other leading pruning-at-initialization techniques, showcasing superior generalization and computational efficiency.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Meta-Learning Sparse Neural Architectures through Differentiable Network Pruning

We propose a Graph-Based Active Learning framework (GBAL-NER) that explicitly models token-level relationships to improve query selection. We construct a dynamic graph where tokens are nodes and edges represent syntactic and semantic affinities. A Graph Attention Network (GAT) propagates information across this structure, producing context-aware representations. To quantify uncertainty, we employ Monte Carlo dropout to approximate the Bayesian posterior over model parameters, yielding robust estimates for both token and sequence-level ambiguity. Our novel acquisition function, Graph-aware Mutual Information (GMI), prioritizes instances that maximally reduce uncertainty across interconnected graph components. On several low-resource biomedical and legal NER datasets, GBAL-NER significantly outperforms standard AL strategies like BALD and entropy sampling, achieving higher F1 scores with the same annotation budget.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Probabilistic Graph-Based Active Learning for Low-Resource Named Entity Recognition
"Reliable uncertainty quantification is critical for the safe deployment of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents in high-stakes environments. We present a principled and scalable method to decompose predictive uncertainty into its aleatoric (data) and epistemic (model) components within a DRL framework. Our approach leverages stochastic variational dropout, interpreting dropout as an approximation to a deep Gaussian process, to model the posterior distribution over the agent's value or policy network weights. By computing the variance of multiple stochastic forward passes, we derive separate estimates for aleatoric uncertainty, intrinsic to environmental stochasticity, and epistemic uncertainty, which reflects the agent's lack of knowledge. We demonstrate how this decomposition can be used to drive more efficient and safer exploration strategies. In continuous control benchmarks and a simulated autonomous driving task, our uncertainty-aware agent exhibits superior sample efficiency and avoids catastrophic failures by adopting risk-averse policies in states with high epistemic uncertainty, significantly outperforming ensembles and standard epsilon-greedy exploration.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Quantifying Aleatoric and Epistemic Uncertainty in Deep Reinforcement Learning using Stochastic Variational Dropout
"Forecasting human trajectories in complex, multi-agent scenes is challenging due to intricate social interactions and inherent stochasticity. We propose the Spatiotemporal Graph Transformer (STGT), a novel architecture that captures these dependencies for accurate, multimodal trajectory prediction. Our model first constructs a dynamic graph at each timestep, where nodes represent agents and edges encode their spatial proximity. A graph attention network (GAT) is employed to learn socially-aware agent representations by aggregating information from neighbors. These representations are then fed into a temporal Transformer encoder, whose self-attention mechanism models long-range dynamics and inter-agent influences over time. To capture the multimodal nature of future paths, the decoder uses a set of learned anchor trajectories, generating a probability distribution over plausible futures. Evaluated on the ETH/UCY and nuScenes datasets, STGT achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing final displacement error by up to 15% and demonstrating superior ability to predict diverse and socially compliant trajectories.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Spatiotemporal Graph Transformers for Multimodal Human Trajectory Forecasting
"Solving inverse problems within a Bayesian framework provides a principled approach to uncertainty quantification, but is often intractable for high-dimensional, non-linear forward models due to the prohibitive cost of posterior sampling via MCMC. We propose an amortized inference framework that leverages conditional normalizing flows to directly learn a mapping from an observation to the corresponding posterior distribution. Our model, a conditional invertible neural network, is trained to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between its output and the true posterior over a distribution of simulated data. Once trained, the network can perform inference for a new observation in a single forward pass, generating an arbitrary number of independent posterior samples instantly. This amortization strategy bypasses the need for per-observation MCMC.

"Learning disentangled representations—where distinct latent units capture independent factors of variation—is a key challenge in unsupervised learning. We propose a novel framework, Adversarially Guided Information Maximization (AGIM), that achieves robust disentanglement without requiring supervised data or extensive hyperparameter tuning. Our approach extends the InfoGAN objective by incorporating an adversarial regularizer that explicitly penalizes statistical dependence among latent variables. The model, based on a variational autoencoder architecture, maximizes the mutual information between observed data and a subset of the latent code, while a discriminator network attempts to predict one set of latent codes from the others. This min-max game forces the encoder to produce a factorial posterior, thus encouraging disentanglement. We provide theoretical justification for our objective and demonstrate empirically on dSprites, 3D Chairs, and MPI3D datasets that AGIM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods like FactorVAE and β-TCVAE on established disentanglement metrics, while also yielding higher quality reconstructions.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Self-Supervised Disentanglement of Latent Representations via Mutual Information Maximization and Adversarial Feedback

Our key contribution is the development of a stable Riemannian optimization scheme, using a well-conditioned Riemannian Adam optimizer and a robust projection mechanism to ensure embeddings remain within the manifold. This enables the effective training of multi-layered hyperbolic perceptrons and graph neural networks.

First, it employs an online variant of Synaptic Intelligence (SI) to compute a per-parameter importance measure, dynamically regularizing changes to weights crucial for past tasks. Second, it utilizes Orthogonal Gradient Projection (OGP), which projects the gradients for the current task onto the null space of feature representations from previous tasks, minimizing interference in the learned representation space.

Our proposed model, the Causal Disentangled VAE (CD-VAE), leverages a structural causal model (SCM) prior and performs amortized interventional inference. By optimizing an evidence lower bound (ELBO) augmented with a term that encourages consistency with the principles of do-calculus, our model learns to separate statistically independent causal mechanisms. We demonstrate empirically on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets that the CD-VAE can identify true causal variables from observational data, even with latent confounders.

Existing certification methods predominantly rely on bounding the model's Lipschitz constant within L_p-norm threat models, which may not capture semantically meaningful perturbations. Our approach, Topological Robustness Certification (TRC), provides a certified radius of input perturbation within which the persistent homology of the model's intermediate activation layers remains stable. By enforcing topological invariance—specifically, the preservation of Betti numbers representing connected components and holes—we can guarantee that the model's high-level feature abstraction is structurally unchanged. This provides a more global and interpretable form of robustness than local gradient-based measures. We demonstrate that TRC can certify against complex geometric distortions and non-L_p perturbations where traditional methods fail, establishing a new frontier in provable adversarial defense.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,AI,Generated,Topological Certified Robustness against Adversarial Perturbations using Persistent Homology

"Transcriptional regulation is characterized by stochastic bursts of mRNA synthesis, yet the epigenetic mechanisms governing bursting kinetics remain poorly understood. Here, we integrate live-cell single-molecule imaging, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), and high-resolution microscopy to demonstrate that histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) is a critical determinant of transcriptional burst frequency. We show that targeted recruitment of the p300/CBP acetyltransferase induces hyper-acetylation at enhancer and promoter regions, leading to the formation of liquid-like transcriptional condensates enriched in BRD4 and Mediator. These phase-separated microenvironments do not significantly alter burst size but dramatically increase burst frequency by facilitating more efficient Pol II recruitment and pre-initiation complex assembly.

"Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) into biomolecular condensates is fundamental to cellular organization, but the mechanisms regulating their material properties are poorly understood. Here, we investigate the role of post-translational modifications, specifically arginine methylation, in modulating the phase behavior of FUS, an RBP implicated in ALS. Using in vitro reconstitution assays with purified components, we demonstrate that methylation of arginine residues within the low-complexity domain of FUS by protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) systematically decreases its propensity to phase separate. Microrheology experiments reveal that methylation converts FUS condensates from viscous, liquid-like droplets into more dynamic, fluid states. This alteration in material properties correlates with enhanced mRNA mobility and translational efficiency within the condensates. We propose that arginine methylation acts as a dynamic 'valence-modulating' switch, controlling the strength of intermolecular interactions to tune the biophysical characteristics and downstream function of RBP condensates, a mechanism whose dysregulation likely contributes to pathological protein aggregation.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Arginine Methylation Acts as a Valence-Modulating Switch to Control the Material Properties and Function of FUS-family RNA-binding Proteins in Biomolecular Condensates
"The coordination between the CMG helicase and replicative DNA polymerases is critical for the fidelity and processivity of DNA replication. The dynamic nature of this coupling, however, is obscured in ensemble measurements. Here, we employed a multi-color single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) assay to visualize the real-time conformational dynamics of the reconstituted eukaryotic replisome. Our data reveal that the leading-strand polymerase (Pol ε) is tightly coupled to CMG translocation, existing predominantly in a high-FRET synthesis state. In contrast, the lagging-strand polymerase (Pol δ) exhibits transient, stochastic dissociations from the replisome, consistent with its distributive synthesis of Okazaki fragments. Upon encountering a simulated DNA lesion, we observed frequent, short-lived backtracking of the entire replisome, a state characterized by a distinct FRET signature, which provides a kinetic window for lesion bypass or repair pathways to engage. These single-molecule insights illuminate the intricate choreography and error-correction mechanisms operating at the heart of the replication fork.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Single-Molecule FRET Analysis Reveals Helicase-Polymerase Coupling Dynamics and Backtracking Mechanisms at the Eukaryotic Replication Fork
"Cells adapt to environmental stress by rapidly remodeling their proteome, often through translational control. To dissect the mechanisms underlying this adaptation to hypoxia, we performed ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) coupled with tRNA sequencing in human cells. Our analysis revealed widespread, codon-specific translational pausing at discrete sites across thousands of transcripts. This pausing was not correlated with general codon usage frequency but showed a strong inverse correlation with the abundance of specific tRNA isoacceptors, particularly those decoding proline (CCG) and glycine (GGC) codons, which become depleted under hypoxic conditions. We demonstrate that this tRNA scarcity-induced pausing leads to reduced protein output from specific transcripts enriched in these codons, including those encoding components of the mTORC1 signaling pathway. This selective translational throttling represents a novel, codon-based regulatory logic that allows cells to fine-tune protein synthesis and conserve resources, linking the tRNA pool directly to adaptive gene expression programs during cellular stress.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Ribosome Profiling Uncovers a Widespread Mechanism of Translational Pausing Mediated by Specific tRNA Isoacceptor Scarcity during Hypoxic Stress
"The intricate architecture of the mitochondrial inner membrane, characterized by invaginations called cristae, is crucial for efficient oxidative phosphorylation. The molecular machinery governing cristae morphology is still being elucidated. We identify a novel 60 kDa protein, MITRAC60, as a key regulator of this process. Using quantitative proteomics and co-immunoprecipitation, we show that MITRAC60 is a core component of a stable complex with the MICOS machinery, specifically interacting with MIC19 and MIC25 at cristae junctions. Super-resolution microscopy and electron tomography of MITRAC60 knockout cells reveal severe disorganization of cristae, characterized by loss of junctions and the formation of concentric, onion-like inner membrane structures. Blue native PAGE analysis further demonstrates that the absence of MITRAC60 impairs the assembly and stability of respiratory chain supercomplexes, leading to a significant reduction in cellular respiration and ATP production. Our findings establish MITRAC60 as an essential factor linking cristae architecture to the functional organization of the electron transport chain.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,The Inner Mitochondrial Membrane Protein MITRAC60 Regulates Cristae Architecture and Supercomplex Assembly through Interactions with the MICOS Complex
"A significant fraction of cancers maintains telomere length through a telomerase-independent mechanism known as Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT), which relies on homologous recombination. The initiating events of ALT remain controversial. Here, we utilize advanced genomic and cellular assays to demonstrate that ALT is triggered by replication stress-induced DNA double-strand breaks at fragile telomeric sites. Using a novel assay to map break-induced replication (BIR) intermediates, we show that these breaks initiate a specialized form of BIR that utilizes homologous telomeric sequences on other chromosomes as templates for synthesis. This process generates characteristic ALT hallmarks, including extrachromosomal C-circles and heterogeneous telomere lengths. Critically, we find that depletion of key Fanconi Anemia (FA) pathway components, such as FANCD2, abrogates ALT-associated BIR and leads to telomere crisis, identifying the FA pathway as a critical regulator of ALT activity. This work provides a definitive molecular mechanism for ALT initiation and highlights a synthetic lethal vulnerability for ALT-positive cancers.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Biyoloji,Generated,Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres is Initiated by Break-Induced Replication at Fragile Telomeric Sites and Regulated by the Fanconi Anemia Pathway

This study investigates the genomic underpinnings of this divergence by integrating comparative transcriptomics, ATAC-seq, and functional genomics in amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae), tunicate (Ciona intestinalis), and zebrafish (Danio rerio). We identified a core set of deeply conserved transcription factors but reveal extensive rewiring of their downstream cis-regulatory elements (CREs). Functional validation using CRISPR-mediated enhancer knockouts in zebrafish demonstrates that while orthologous CREs often regulate homologous genes, their spatiotemporal activity and quantitative outputs have diverged significantly. Our results indicate that pleiotropic constraints on core transcription factors are circumvented by evolutionary tinkering at the level of enhancers, allowing for lineage-specific modifications of a conserved developmental blueprint. This modularity in gene regulatory network architecture provides a powerful mechanism for generating morphological novelty while preserving essential developmental functions.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Cis-Regulatory Divergence and Pleiotropic Constraints in the Evolution of Chordate Pharyngeal Arch Patterning

However, the selective pressures shaping the retention of these archaic alleles remain debated. We present a high-resolution analysis of 275 ancient Eurasian genomes spanning the last 10,000 years, focusing on introgressed haplotypes within immune-related loci, including the Toll-like receptor (TLR) gene cluster and OAS antiviral genes. Using a novel Bayesian framework to model allele frequency trajectories, we demonstrate that specific archaic haplotypes underwent strong positive selection during the Neolithic transition, coinciding with increased population densities and zoonotic disease exposure. These alleles are associated with altered cytokine responses in modern cell-based assays. Our findings suggest that archaic introgression provided a critical reservoir of pre-adapted immunogenetic variants, which were rapidly favored by selection, facilitating human adaptation to novel pathogenic environments.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Adaptive Introgression of Archaic Hominin Alleles Modulated Holocene-Era Pathogen Defense Landscapes in Eurasian Populations
"Antagonistic coevolution between bacteria and their bacteriophage predators is a major driver of microbial diversity. Here, we investigate the molecular dynamics of this arms race by experimentally coevolving Pseudomonas aeruginosa with its lytic phage DMS3vir. Using time-series population genomics and shotgun proteomics, we uncovered a rapid and recurrent amplification of polymorphic toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems. Phages evolved sophisticated anti-toxin mimics to neutralize bacterial defenses, while bacteria responded by diversifying their toxin repertoires or modifying the toxin-antitoxin binding interface. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that these TA loci are frequently exchanged via horizontal gene transfer, acting as mobile defense cassettes. Our results demonstrate that the coevolutionary conflict imposes strong, fluctuating selection, maintaining a remarkable diversity of TA systems within bacterial populations. This dynamic interplay represents a key microcosm of Red Queen dynamics, where molecular innovation is continuously required to maintain relative fitness.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Reciprocal Antagonistic Coevolution Drives Rapid Diversification of Toxin-Antitoxin Systems in a Bacteriophage-Host Arms Race

Utilizing a Bayesian relaxed molecular clock with fossilized birth-death process priors, our analysis robustly places the origin of Bilateria in the late Ediacaran, significantly predating the fossil record of crown-group members. Trait evolution models, employing stochastic character mapping, indicate that the acquisition of key developmental toolkits (e.g., Hox and Wnt gene clusters) preceded morphological diversification. Our findings suggest that the 'explosion' was not a sudden origin of phyla, but rather the ecological release and morphological realization of deeply rooted genetic potential, likely triggered by a confluence of environmental factors like oceanic oxygenation.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,A Fossil-Calibrated Phylogenomic Framework Reveals Cryptic Drivers of the Cambrian Explosion
"The evolution of robustness, or canalization, against genetic perturbation is a fundamental property of biological systems, yet its origins are poorly understood. We developed a multi-locus, agent-based simulation to model population evolution on NK fitness landscapes of tunable ruggedness. Our model incorporates a quantitative modifier locus that controls the expression of epistatic interactions among fitness-determining loci. We demonstrate that populations evolving on rugged landscapes consistently evolve higher levels of canalization. This occurs through a process of 'epistatic ratcheting,' where stabilizing selection favors alleles at the modifier locus that mask the deleterious effects of mutations at other loci. This buffering allows populations to accumulate cryptic genetic variation. Critically, we show that periodic environmental shifts can then release this stored variation, facilitating rapid adaptation. This research provides a mechanistic explanation for how evolvability itself can be a direct target of selection.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Epistatic Ratcheting and the Evolution of Genetic Canalization on Rugged Fitness Landscapes
"Understanding the genomic architecture of reproductive isolation is central to speciation research. We performed whole-genome sequencing of 150 individuals across a hybrid zone between two incipient species of Heliconius butterflies, H. cydno and H. melpomene. Using FST and Patterson's D-statistic scans, we identified multiple discrete 'genomic islands' of high divergence, which resist homogenization despite ongoing gene flow. Notably, these islands are significantly enriched for structural variants (SVs), particularly large inversions. One 3.5 Mbp inversion on chromosome 15 contains the optix transcription factor, a major determinant of wing color pattern, and multiple genes implicated in mate preference. We posit that these inversions act as supergenes, linking ecologically important traits with mate choice loci, thereby suppressing recombination and facilitating the buildup of Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities.

"Predicting evolutionary responses to complex, fluctuating environments is a major challenge. We subjected 100 replicate populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to long-term experimental evolution under conditions of oscillating glucose and galactose limitation. Through periodic whole-genome, whole-transcriptome sequencing, we tracked the adaptive trajectories in real time. We observed remarkable parallelism at the gene level, with recurrent mutations in key regulators of carbon catabolite repression, such as MIG1 and GAL80. However, at the network level, we found convergent evolution of distinct metabolic strategies. Some lineages evolved enhanced substrate switching efficiency through cis-regulatory mutations, while others adopted a more generalist strategy by constitutively upregulating both pathways, incurring a cost-of-carry. These divergent solutions to the same adaptive problem highlight the multifarious paths available on the fitness landscape and demonstrate that while genomic targets of selection can be predictable, the resulting network-level adaptations can be highly contingent.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Parallel and Convergent Evolution of Metabolic Networks in Experimentally Evolved Saccharomyces cerevisiae Under Oscillating Nutrient Stress

To uncover its molecular underpinnings, we conducted a comparative transcriptomic analysis of brain tissue from queens and workers across 15 independently evolved eusocial Hymenoptera species. By controlling for phylogeny, we identified a core suite of 87 genes showing convergent caste-biased expression. These genes are significantly enriched for neuropeptide signaling pathways, including insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) and vitellogenin, key modulators of reproduction and foraging behavior in solitary ancestors. Our results suggest that the evolution of eusociality repeatedly co-opted and rewired these ancestral neuroendocrine pathways, repurposing them to regulate social behavior rather than individual reproduction. This molecular convergence provides a powerful example of how existing genetic toolkits can be evolutionarily redeployed to generate complex social phenotypes, offering a unifying framework for the origins of altruism.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Neurogenomic Correlates of Eusociality: Convergent Evolution of Neuropeptide Regulation in Hymenoptera

We exposed isogenic F0-generation individuals to simulated predator cues and performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) on F0, F1, and F2 generations, which were not directly exposed. We identified hundreds of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with predator exposure, particularly in genes linked to neurogenesis and stress response. A significant subset of these DMRs was stably inherited through to the F2 generation, correlating with heritable changes in anti-predator behaviors and defensive spine morphology. These findings provide compelling evidence for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance as a mechanism for rapid, adaptive parental effects, potentially bridging the gap between short-term plasticity and long-term genetic adaptation in fluctuating environments.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Transgenerational Epigenetic Inheritance of DNA Methylation Patterns Mediates Adaptive Phenotypic Plasticity in Threespine Stickleback

These HGT-derived genes are not randomly distributed but form functional metabolic clusters, including pathways for cellulose degradation and novel amino acid synthesis. Expression analyses confirm these genes are highly active in the ants' metapleural glands, which secrete antimicrobial compounds. We conclude that a massive influx of bacterial genetic material provided the metabolic toolkit necessary for the Attine ants to transition to their unique fungivorous niche, demonstrating that HGT can be a potent engine of metabolic innovation in multicellular animals.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Massive Horizontal Gene Transfer of Bacterial Metabolic Pathways Catalyzed the Adaptive Radiation of Fungus-Growing Ants

We introduce a novel decoding algorithm, the 'Homological Weighted Blossom' (HWB) decoder, which leverages the geometric structure of the anyonic worldlines to infer the most likely error chains. Our simulations reveal a significantly higher error threshold (p_th ≈ 2.1 x 10⁻³) compared to previous estimates using standard minimum-weight perfect matching decoders. This enhanced resilience is attributed to the HWB decoder's ability to correctly interpret complex error syndromes involving anyon fusion and annihilation events.

By employing large-scale exact diagonalization and time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) methods, we compute the OTOCs to probe the scrambling of quantum information. In the thermal phase, we observe exponential growth of the OTOC, characteristic of quantum chaos, with a scrambling rate approaching the universal bound. Conversely, in the MBL phase, the OTOC exhibits only logarithmic growth, indicating the suppression of information scrambling and the persistence of local memory. We precisely map the critical disorder strength for the MBL transition by analyzing the scaling properties of the OTOC growth exponent, providing a new dynamical signature that distinguishes these fundamentally different phases of quantum matter.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Kuantum,Generated,Probing the Many-Body Localization Transition via Out-of-Time-Order Correlators in a Disordered Spin-1/2 Heisenberg Chain

Specifically, we compute the holographic entanglement entropy using the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for a CFT perturbed by a relevant, spatially modulated operator. The deformation induces a non-trivial change in the bulk metric, leading to deviations in the minimal surface area. Our results demonstrate that for certain classes of deformations, the entanglement entropy exhibits non-local features that cannot be explained by a simple local quantum field theory, yet the causal structure of the boundary theory is preserved. This suggests a subtle encoding of sub-AdS scale locality within the entanglement structure of the boundary theory.

We characterize the generated state using the two-body correlation function and the Husimi Q-function, confirming the presence of strong non-classical correlations and macroscopic coherence.

We present a theoretical model and experimental evidence for spatially correlated dephasing induced by a shared bath of TLS defects in a linear array of five transmon qubits. By simultaneously measuring the Ramsey decay of multiple qubits, we observe strong temporal correlations in their frequency fluctuations, which cannot be explained by independent TLS interactions. Our model, which considers the overlapping electric fields of adjacent qubits coupling to the same TLS bath, quantitatively reproduces the observed cross-correlation spectral density.

We confirm this conjecture for several graph classes, including those with bounded treewidth and certain families of claw-free graphs. Our main result provides strong evidence via a spectral relaxation. We prove that if G is a d-degenerate graph whose normalized Laplacian has a principal eigenvalue λ_1(L(G)) satisfying a specific lower bound dependent on d and t, then G must contain a K_⌈t⌉ minor. The proof technique involves a novel potential function argument combined with spectral graph partitioning.

The protocol leverages engineered dissipation within a coupled cavity system, where a Kerr-nonlinear ancilla resonator selectively couples to the error-syndrome components of the GKP state's Wigner function. This continuous, Hamiltonian-based feedback mechanism autonomously corrects for single-photon loss, the dominant error channel, without requiring active measurement or classical processing. Through master equation simulations, we demonstrate that the scheme can stabilize the GKP code space, achieving a logical error rate suppression that surpasses the break-even threshold for fault-tolerant quantum computation.

By cooling the nanosphere's center-of-mass motion close to its quantum ground state and monitoring its subsequent heating rate with exceptional precision, we place new bounds on the parameters of these collapse models. Our data analysis, which carefully accounts for all known classical and quantum noise sources, reveals no anomalous heating.

Guided by sgRNAs targeting the promoters of core pluripotency factors OCT4 and SOX2 in terminally differentiated fibroblasts, the dCas9-UTX fusion protein induced robust and locus-specific removal of the repressive H3K27me3 mark. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) confirmed a significant reduction in H3K27me3 occupancy at targeted loci, concomitant with an increase in the activating H3K4me3 mark.

This process is significantly enhanced by its association with acetylated histone H3 tails and the Mediator complex. Importantly, we identify a cluster of lysine residues within the IDR whose auto-acetylation by p300/CBP serves as a critical regulatory switch. Acetylation neutralizes charge, promoting homotypic interactions and stabilizing BRD4 condensates.

Sequestration of miR-137 by circSNHG14 de-represses its target, ATG5, a key component of the autophagy machinery. Lentiviral-mediated overexpression of circSNHG14 in 5xFAD mice restored ATG5 levels, enhanced autophagic clearance of amyloid-beta plaques, and rescued synaptic plasticity deficits.

While global translational attenuation via eIF2α phosphorylation is well-established, codon-specific regulatory mechanisms remain elusive. Employing ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) in human cells subjected to endoplasmic reticulum stress, we uncovered profound, codon-specific changes in translational efficiency. Ribosome occupancy decreased at codons decoded by tRNA species that become limited during stress but paradoxically increased at specific non-optimal codons, particularly within the 5' leaders of stress-response transcripts like ATF4. This effect is independent of general amino acid starvation and correlates with stress-induced modifications of tRNA anticodon loops. We propose a model where tRNA modifications and availability create a codon-biased translational landscape that selectively favors the synthesis of key regulatory proteins.

We investigated the role of the ATP-dependent LonP1 protease in this process using *Caenorhabditis elegans*. We found that mild overexpression of LONP-1 is sufficient to extend lifespan and enhance resistance to mitochondrial stressors. This pro-longevity effect requires the canonical UPRmt transcription factor ATFS-1. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we identified a specific subset of mitochondrial matrix proteins that are selectively degraded by LONP-1 under basal conditions, preventing their aggregation. Upon stress, LONP-1 activity also processes pre-ATFS-1, liberating the fragment required for nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation of cytoprotective genes.

In multipotent progenitors, HOTTIP expression is high, and it physically tethers the EZH2 subunit of PRC2 to the promoters of key lymphoid-lineage commitment genes, such as IKAROS and GATA3, leading to their H3K27me3-mediated silencing and favoring myeloid differentiation. Genetic ablation of HOTTIP in HSCs results in a loss of PRC2 occupancy at these specific loci, de-repression of the lymphoid program, and a skewed differentiation potential.

This ubiquitination event is contingent upon prior phosphorylation of Raptor at serine 863 by Akt. Using proximity-ligation assays and super-resolution microscopy, we demonstrate that ubiquitinated Raptor directly interacts with the lysosomal p18/LAMTOR1 subunit of the Ragulator complex, a critical step for mTORC1 translocation. A non-ubiquitinatable Raptor mutant fails to localize to lysosomes and exhibits blunted downstream signaling, even in the presence of ample amino acids.

The structure captures the PA endonuclease domain in a catalytically active state, revealing how two divalent manganese ions coordinate the RNA phosphodiester backbone for cleavage precisely 10-13 nucleotides downstream of the cap. Our inhibitor does not bind the active site but instead occupies an allosteric pocket at the interface of the PA and PB1 subunits. Inhibitor binding induces a conformational shift that displaces a critical α-helix, misaligning the catalytic residues and abrogating endonuclease activity without preventing substrate binding.

We performed a comprehensive phylogenomic analysis of 250 archaeal genomes to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) complex and associated pathways. Using species-tree/gene-tree reconciliation methods and Bayesian inference on concatenated orthologous gene sets, we uncovered extensive incongruence indicative of rampant horizontal gene transfer (HGT). While the core MCR subunits exhibit strong vertical inheritance, auxiliary genes involved in coenzyme biosynthesis and electron transport show a mosaic pattern, with multiple HGT events detected across Euryarchaeota phyla. Our findings support a model of metabolic chimerism, where a conserved ancestral core pathway was repeatedly augmented by laterally acquired modules. This network-like evolution, rather than simple cladogenesis, drove the diversification of methanogenic metabolisms, highlighting the critical role of HGT in shaping microbial innovation across geological timescales.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Phylogenomic Reconstruction of Archaeal Methanogenesis Reveals Cryptic Horizontal Gene Transfer and Metabolic Chimerism
"The conservation of the pentadactyl limb across tetrapods despite vast ecological diversification suggests profound developmental constraints. We investigated the role of pleiotropy within the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) governing limb patterning. Employing comparative transcriptomics across key developmental stages in *Xenopus laevis* and *Gallus gallus*, coupled with targeted CRISPR-Cas9 perturbations of key transcription factors like *Hoxd13* and *Shh*, we mapped the downstream consequences. Our results reveal that central nodes in the limb-patterning GRN possess extensive pleiotropic linkages to fundamental cellular processes, including apoptosis and cell cycle regulation. Perturbations resulted not in viable alternative morphologies but in catastrophic, system-wide failures. This high degree of pleiotropic constraint provides a mechanistic basis for the observed canalization of limb development, severely limiting the accessible morphospace and explaining the long-term stasis of the foundational pentadactyl body plan.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Pleiotropic Constraints and the Canalization of Developmental Pathways in Early Tetrapod Limb Morphogenesis

We examined this evolutionary arms race between the fruit fly *Drosophila melanogaster* and its endoparasitoid wasp *Leptopilina boulardi* through population genomics. By analyzing whole-genome sequences from multiple sympatric and allopatric populations, we identified signatures of recurrent selective sweeps. In *Drosophila*, loci under positive selection were significantly enriched for genes involved in the Toll and Imd innate immune pathways, particularly recognition and effector proteins. Conversely, in *L. boulardi*, rapidly evolving genes were predominantly small, secreted venom proteins hypothesized to be immunosuppressants. Analyses of nucleotide diversity (π) and dN/dS ratios confirm that these specific gene classes are coevolutionary hotspots. Our findings provide a high-resolution genomic portrait of reciprocal selection, demonstrating how ongoing conflict shapes genetic architecture at the host-parasite interface.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Genomic Signatures of Antagonistic Coevolution in a Host-Endoparasitoid System

We applied Bayesian phylogenetic comparative methods to a large dataset of planktonic foraminifera, quantifying multitrait morphospace occupation across the K-Pg boundary. By modeling trait evolution on a robust molecular-clock-calibrated phylogeny, we tested for correlations between morphological traits and extinction probability. Our results indicate strong selectivity against ornamental complexity and larger test sizes, while species with simpler, globular morphologies had significantly higher survival rates. An Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model best fit the macroevolutionary dynamics, suggesting a post-extinction radiation into a narrower range of the previously occupied morphospace, consistent with a shift in stabilizing selection pressures in the depauperate early Paleocene ocean.

"Female mate choice is often presumed to be driven by direct benefits or 'good genes'. We propose an alternative mechanism: the transmission of environmentally induced epigenetic information via paternal germlines. We developed a model system in the decorated cricket (*Gryllodes sigillatus*), where males provide a nuptial gift. Males were raised on nutrient-rich or nutrient-poor diets, and we analyzed sperm DNA methylation profiles using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. We found significant diet-dependent differential methylation regions (DMRs) in genes associated with metabolic regulation and stress response. Critically, females provided with a choice overwhelmingly preferred males from the nutrient-rich treatment, and their offspring exhibited higher fitness, a benefit not explainable by gift size alone. This suggests that females may be selecting mates based on cues that honestly signal a favorable paternal epigenetic state, adding a new dimension of transgenerational inheritance to the study of sexual selection.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,The Role of Epigenetic Paternal Effects in the Evolution of Nuptial Gifting and Female Mate Choice

Using haplotype-based statistics, we confirmed that a critical allele of the *EPAS1* gene, which modulates the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway, was introduced into the modern human gene pool from Denisovan-like hominins. Our analysis reveals that this introgressed haplotype is exceptionally long, indicating a recent and powerful selective sweep. Furthermore, functional genomic assays suggest the archaic variant provides a more buffered physiological response to hypoxia, preventing the maladaptive erythrocytosis seen in lowlanders. This case provides a compelling example of adaptive introgression, where archaic admixture provided pre-adapted genetic variation that facilitated rapid colonization of a novel, challenging environment.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Archaic Introgression and the Adaptive Evolution of the High-Altitude Hypoxia Response in Tibetan Populations
"Parallel evolution offers a powerful framework for dissecting the predictability of adaptation. Marine populations of threespine stickleback have repeatedly colonized freshwater habitats, evolving similar phenotypes. We investigated the genomic basis of this parallelism by sequencing multiple marine-freshwater population pairs from distinct drainages. Using a combination of FST outlier analysis and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping for osmoregulatory traits, we identified numerous genomic regions under divergent selection. While a small number of large-effect loci, such as *Eda* and *Atp1a1*, were recurrently selected across all pairs, the majority of the genomic architecture was lineage-specific. This indicates that parallel phenotypic outcomes were achieved through a mosaic of shared and unique genetic solutions.

We explored the role of compartmentalization in the evolution of RNA-based autocatalytic networks. Using in-vitro compartmentalization systems with lipid vesicles, we encapsulated a diverse pool of random-sequence ribozymes. We demonstrate that stochastic encapsulation creates micro-environments with varied catalytic compositions. Vesicles containing more efficient or specific autocatalytic sets grew faster by sequestering substrates and products, leading to a form of protocellular-level selection. Over iterative cycles of growth and division, we observed a marked increase in the average catalytic efficiency and specificity of the encapsulated ribozyme populations compared to bulk-solution controls.

Using a synteny-based framework to identify ohnolog pairs, we found that approximately 80% have been retained. By quantifying expression divergence, we determined that subfunctionalization, partitioned by tissue-specific expression, is the dominant fate. However, a significant subset (~12%) of ohnologs exhibit signatures of neofunctionalization, characterized by novel expression domains and accelerated rates of protein sequence evolution (elevated dN/dS). These neofunctionalized genes are enriched in functions related to neural development and immunity, suggesting the TS-WGD was pivotal in the evolutionary diversification of these complex systems in teleost fishes.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Subfunctionalization and Neofunctionalization Dynamics Following Whole-Genome Duplication in Basal Actinopterygii
"We investigate the dynamics of quantum information in periodically driven, non-Hermitian topological systems. By engineering a two-dimensional lattice model with gain and loss, subjected to a time-periodic drive, we demonstrate the emergence of anomalous Floquet topological phases absent in Hermitian counterparts. Our analysis reveals the existence of topologically protected chiral edge modes that are robust against both Hermitian perturbations and non-Hermitian dissipation. A key finding is the stabilization of these modes at exceptional points in the Floquet quasienergy spectrum, leading to a non-Hermitian skin effect that localizes the majority of bulk states to the boundary. We show numerically that a quantum state encoded in these edge modes exhibits significantly suppressed decoherence rates compared to bulk states, providing a novel platform for topologically protected quantum state transfer. The proposed model is experimentally feasible in coupled photonic waveguide arrays or ultracold atomic systems with controlled dissipation, opening new avenues for robust quantum technologies.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Kuantum,Generated,Topological Protection of Coherent States in Non-Hermitian Floquet Insulators
"The transition from an ergodic thermal phase to a many-body localized (MBL) phase represents a fundamental breakdown of statistical mechanics in isolated quantum systems. We move beyond conventional diagnostics like entanglement entropy to probe this transition using entanglement spectroscopy. By applying large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations to the disordered one-dimensional Heisenberg model, we analyze the full spectrum of the reduced density matrix. Our results reveal a qualitative change in the entanglement spectrum structure at the MBL transition: in the ergodic phase, it follows predictions from the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) with a universal low-lying structure, while in the MBL phase, it exhibits a Poissonian level-spacing distribution and a distinct lack of universal form. The Schmidt gap, separating low-lying eigenvalues, closes at the transition point, serving as a more precise order parameter than entanglement entropy scaling. This spectroscopic approach provides a finer-grained characterization of the MBL transition and deepens our understanding of emergent integrability in disordered quantum matter.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Kuantum,Generated,Probing Many-Body Localization Transitions with Entanglement Spectroscopy in Disordered Spin Chains

Through precise temporal control of laser parameters, we observe the real-time evolution of particle-antiparticle pairs and the propagation of electric fields. Notably, our system exhibits Hilbert space fragmentation into dynamically disconnected sectors, leading to the appearance of fracton-like excitations with restricted mobility.

By constructing a MERA state that variationally approximates the ground state of a QCD-like theory, we bypass the sign problem entirely. The geometry of the tensor network itself serves as an emergent holographic dimension, where the entanglement structure of the boundary state encodes the bulk geometry. Our model successfully captures key non-perturbative features, including chiral symmetry breaking and confinement.

Solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations self-consistently, we demonstrate the emergence of a robust topological superconducting phase hosting spatially separated MZMs at the nanoribbon ends. The spin-valley locking in graphene, combined with the anisotropic superconducting gap, eliminates the need for external magnetic fields and fine-tuning of chemical potential. We simulate an explicit braiding protocol by electrostatically moving the MZMs in a T-junction geometry.

We prepare a macroscopic superposition of coherent states (a 'cat state') within the cavity, where the state's phase is entangled with the qutrit's state. By performing sequential, high-fidelity projective measurements on the qutrit, we implement a protocol that tests the LGI for a three-time correlation function. Crucially, we utilize a quasi-ideal negative result measurement protocol to minimize back-action, a key loophole in previous experiments. Our results show a violation of the LGI by more than 12 standard deviations, providing strong evidence against the classical worldview of macroscopic realism even in large, engineered quantum systems.

By applying a strong parametric drive to the YIG sphere, we induce a two-mode squeezing interaction between two distinct magnon modes. This process generates a quantum-correlated state exhibiting reduced quantum fluctuations in a specific field quadrature, well below the vacuum noise level. We show that the phase-sensitive response of this squeezed magnonic state to an external magnetic field enables a measurement sensitivity that scales as 1/N, where N is the number of magnons, thus approaching the fundamental Heisenberg limit. Our theoretical model, including realistic dissipation channels, predicts a significant enhancement over the SQL for experimentally achievable parameters in cavity magnonic systems, paving the way for ultra-sensitive quantum sensors.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Kuantum,Generated,Quantum-Enhanced Metrology with Squeezed Magnons in a Ferrimagnetic Insulator

By performing large-scale numerical simulations, we analyze the entanglement structure of the system's ground state. We define subsystems based on a partitioning of the matrix degrees of freedom and compute the entanglement entropy between them. Our central finding is that the entanglement structure encodes a consistent emergent geometry. We show that the mutual information between distant subsystems decays in a manner consistent with a power-law, defining an effective distance. Furthermore, the entanglement entropy of a region satisfies an area law with respect to this emergent geometry, providing a discrete analogue of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula from holography.

We study a model of a central spin ensemble coupled to a non-Markovian bosonic reservoir with a tunable spectral density. By employing a combination of Keldysh field theory and the numerical matrix product state methods, we map the system's phase diagram as a function of coupling strength and an environmental control parameter. We identify a critical point where the spectral gap of the system's Liouvillian superoperator closes, signaling a second-order QPT. This transition separates a phase of rapid, exponential decoherence from a phase where a protected decoherence-free subspace emerges due to a quantum Zeno-like effect induced by the structured environment.

By incorporating principles from structural causal models (SCMs) and do-calculus, our model architecture explicitly respects causal identifiability assumptions. We introduce a novel adversarial balancing loss function that minimizes integral probability metrics between treatment groups in a learned representation space.

Subsequently, a calibrated Gaussian noise mechanism is applied to the aggregated, encrypted update to satisfy a pre-defined (ε, δ)-differential privacy budget before decryption and model application. This dual-layered approach provides cryptographic security against server-side threats while offering formal privacy guarantees against information leakage from the final model.

Our approach maintains a set of task-agnostic meta-parameters and learns task-specific modulations. During adaptation to a new few-shot task, we constrain the gradient update to be orthogonal to the subspace spanned by the gradients of previously learned tasks, thereby preventing destructive interference. This is achieved via a computationally efficient projection mechanism integrated into a MAML-like episodic training framework.

A learnable importance score is assigned to each rank-1 component, and an L0-norm penalty is applied during training to encourage sparsity at the rank level. This approach unifies weight pruning and low-rank approximation, allowing for the automatic determination of the optimal rank for each layer based on a global compression budget. Our method induces structured sparsity that is amenable to hardware acceleration.

A key innovation is an in-situ adaptive feedback loop, guided by a Bayesian estimation algorithm, which dynamically adjusts the phase accumulation time to maximize the quantum Fisher information in the presence of realistic noise sources, including photon loss and dephasing. We derive the quantum Cramér-Rao bound for our protocol and demonstrate, through Monte Carlo simulations, a scaling of sensitivity approaching 1/N, where N is the total number of photons, a significant improvement over the standard quantum limit of 1/√N. This work provides a practical blueprint for developing quantum-enhanced sensors capable of surpassing classical devices in applications requiring ultra-high spatial and temporal resolution, such as biomedical imaging and materials science.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Kuantum,Generated,Heisenberg-Limited Magnetometry using Multi-Mode N00N States and Adaptive Bayesian Estimation
"We predict a new class of three-dimensional higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) which we term 'axionic hinge insulators'. Using a combination of ab-initio density functional theory calculations and low-energy effective k·p models, we identify candidate materials in the bismuth halide family. These materials are characterized by a gapped bulk and gapped surfaces, but host protected one-dimensional chiral modes localized on the hinges where surfaces intersect. The topological protection arises from the interplay between time-reversal symmetry and a C4 crystalline rotation symmetry. A defining characteristic of this phase is a quantized magnetoelectric response, where the hinge states act as chiral channels for an axionic field. We propose an experimental signature based on a non-local transport measurement that can uniquely identify the contribution of these one-dimensional hinge states, distinguishing them from trivial edge states or surface conductivity, thus opening a new avenue in topological quantum matter.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Kuantum,Generated,Axionic Hinge Insulators: A Higher-Order Topological Phase Protected by Crystalline Symmetries
"We investigate the performance of a quantum Otto engine whose working medium is a disordered quantum spin chain that can be tuned across the many-body localization (MBL) to ergodic transition. By numerically solving the system's dynamics using Floquet theory and quantum master equations, we analyze the engine's power output and efficiency. Our results reveal a significant performance enhancement when the engine operates near the critical point of the MBL transition. Specifically, we demonstrate that the suppressed thermalization on the MBL side of the transition minimizes dissipative losses during the quasi-adiabatic strokes, while the proximity to the ergodic phase allows for efficient heat exchange with the thermal baths during the isochoric strokes. This finding connects the abstract concept of ergodicity breaking to a tangible thermodynamic advantage and suggests a novel design principle for quantum thermal machines leveraging non-equilibrium phase transitions to outperform their conventional counterparts.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Kuantum,Generated,Thermodynamic Enhancement in a Quantum Otto Cycle at the Many-Body Localization Transition
"We analyze quantum particle production in a (2+1)-dimensional rotating fluid spacetime, which serves as a condensed matter analogue for a Kerr black hole. By calculating the Bogoliubov coefficients that relate the in- and out-vaccum states for a massless scalar field (phonons), we investigate the system's stability against superradiance. We find that for a specific range of rotational parameters, the system exhibits a superradiant instability, leading to an exponential growth of phonon modes and the spontaneous emission of a non-thermal particle flux. Our analysis goes beyond standard treatments by incorporating a realistic equation of state for a Bose-Einstein condensate, revealing a modification of the ergoregion and a corresponding shift in the instability threshold. These results provide quantitative predictions for verifying rotational superradiance and the associated particle creation phenomena in future tabletop experiments using swirling Bose-Einstein condensates, offering an accessible platform to probe fundamental aspects of quantum field theory in curved spacetime.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Kuantum,Generated,Scalar Particle Production from a Superradiantly Unstable Kerr-like Acoustic Metric
"We report the experimental realization of a circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED) system operating in the deep strong coupling (DSC) regime, where the coupling strength becomes comparable to the transition frequencies of the constituents. By coupling a fluxonium qubit to a 3D lumped-element resonator, we achieve a normalized coupling strength g/ω of 0.85. Spectroscopic measurements reveal a highly non-trivial energy-level structure, characterized by the breakdown of the rotating-wave approximation and the significant hybridization of qubit and cavity states. We observe clear signatures of a parity-protected ground state, where the system is dressed by virtual photons. By performing two-tone spectroscopy, we directly probe transitions between these dressed states, confirming predictions of the full quantum Rabi model. This platform enables the exploration of novel phenomena in quantum optics and offers a promising avenue for quantum simulations of light-matter systems and the development of robust, passively-protected quantum information schemes.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Kuantum,Generated,Probing Ground-State Electrodynamics in the Deep Strong Coupling Regime of Cavity QED
"We propose and analyze a protocol for a robust, loophole-free experimental test of quantum contextuality based on the Kochen-Specker theorem. Our system consists of a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, where the electron spin and a strongly coupled ¹³C nuclear spin collectively form a qutrit. We identify a set of 13 measurement projectors, forming a Peres-Mermin square, that can be implemented with high fidelity using precisely timed microwave and radio-frequency control pulses. The protocol is designed to be robust against major experimental imperfections, including finite measurement fidelity and operational errors. By employing a sequential measurement scheme with non-destructive projective readouts, our protocol simultaneously closes the compatibility and detection loopholes that have affected previous tests. We perform a detailed theoretical analysis, including decoherence effects, showing that a statistically significant violation of the non-contextual bound is achievable with current technology, thereby placing stringent constraints on the ontology of quantum mechanics.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Kuantum,Generated,A Loophole-Free Test of Kochen-Specker Contextuality using a Nitrogen-Vacancy Center Qutrit
"The role of cryptic genetic variation (CGV) in macroevolutionary processes remains a subject of intense theoretical debate. We investigated the hypothesis that environmental shifts can trigger the decanalization of CGV, facilitating rapid phenotypic diversification and reproductive isolation. Using experimental evolution in Drosophila melanogaster populations subjected to novel thermal and dietary stressors, we observed a dramatic increase in phenotypic variance for key morphological traits previously buffered by Hsp90. Whole-genome sequencing of divergent lineages revealed that novel phenotypes were associated with the expression of pre-existing, rare alleles within developmental gene regulatory networks. These alleles became penetrant only under stress-induced Hsp90 titration. Furthermore, rapid pre-zygotic isolation evolved as a correlated response to this phenotypic diversification. Our results provide empirical support for a model where environmental perturbation unmasks CGV, creating an evolutionary capacitance that can fuel rapid, saltational speciation events, thereby connecting microevolutionary mechanisms to macroevolutionary patterns.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Decanalization of Cryptic Genetic Variation Drives Explosive Speciation Following Environmental Perturbation
"Resolving the early branches of the Neoaves phylogeny has been a persistent challenge due to its rapid, near-simultaneous diversification. We employed a new phylogenomic approach, integrating exonic, intronic, and ultraconserved element (UCE) data from 363 avian species to reconstruct this radiation. Using coalescent-based species tree methods that explicitly model incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), we resolved several key contentious relationships within the avian tree of life. However, our analyses revealed extensive gene tree discordance concentrated at the base of major clades, a pattern not fully explained by ILS alone. Subsequent Patterson's D-statistic and PhyloNet analyses provided strong evidence for multiple episodes of introgressive hybridization among early neoavian lineages. These findings suggest that the explosive avian radiation was characterized by a porous Felsenstein zone, where reticulate evolution played a significant role in shaping the genomic architecture of modern birds. This complex history challenges purely bifurcating models of speciation.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Phylogenomic Reconciliation of the Avian Radiation Reveals Pervasive Incomplete Lineage Sorting and Introgressive Hybridization
"The Red Queen hypothesis posits that antagonistic coevolution drives the rapid evolution of host resistance genes and pathogen virulence factors. We explored this dynamic at the molecular level by examining a polymorphic Nucleotide-binding Leucine-rich Repeat (NLR) gene cluster in Arabidopsis thaliana and its interaction with a suite of effectors from the oomycete Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis. Using population genomic analyses, we identified strong signatures of balancing selection maintaining divergent NLR haplotypes, alongside evidence for frequent, localized selective sweeps within individual NLR paralogs. In parallel, pathogen effector genes showed high rates of non-synonymous substitution and presence/absence polymorphism. Functional assays using transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana confirmed a direct, recognition-dependent interaction matrix. Our results illustrate a multi-layered arms race, where balancing selection maintains a diverse host defensive repertoire while recurrent positive selection drives innovation in both host recognition and pathogen evasion, perfectly encapsulating coevolutionary escalation.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Antagonistic Coevolutionary Dynamics between a Plant NLR Gene Cluster and a Pathogen Effector Suite
"The contribution of non-genetic inheritance to adaptation remains a pivotal question in evolutionary biology. We investigated the role of heritable DNA methylation in conferring adaptive potential to rapid environmental change. Using multi-generational experimental evolution with the coral reef fish Acanthochromis polyacanthus exposed to elevated pCO2 levels, we tracked epigenetic and transcriptomic changes via whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and RNA-seq. We identified a suite of stress-induced differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in F1 offspring that were stably transmitted to the F3 generation, even after a return to ambient conditions. These inherited epimutations were significantly associated with the regulation of genes involved in acid-base homeostasis and metabolic pathways. Critically, lineages possessing these epialleles exhibited significantly higher fitness upon re-exposure to high pCO2. Our findings demonstrate that transgenerational epigenetic plasticity can act as a rapid response mechanism, providing heritable variation that bridges the gap between short-term physiological acclimation and long-term genetic adaptation.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Transgenerational Epigenetic Inheritance Modulates Adaptive Potential to Climate Change
"The introgression of archaic hominin DNA has provided a reservoir of adaptive alleles for modern human populations. We present a deep-coverage whole-genome sequence of a 40,000-year-old Denisovan individual from Denisova Cave and analyze its contribution to high-altitude adaptation in Tibetans. By employing a novel admixture mapping algorithm, we identified a large, deeply divergent haplotype on chromosome 1 spanning the Endothelial Pas1 (EPAS1) gene, which is present at high frequency in Tibetans but nearly absent elsewhere. This haplotype, containing multiple non-synonymous and regulatory substitutions, shows a perfect sequence match to our sequenced Denisovan genome. Functional luciferase assays and ChIP-seq analysis in a human endothelial cell line demonstrate that the introgressed allele possesses a unique enhancer element that modulates EPAS1 expression under hypoxic conditions. This provides a direct molecular link between archaic introgression and a classic example of human adaptation, illustrating how admixture can facilitate rapid evolution in novel environments.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Paleogenomic Evidence for Adaptive Introgression of an Archaic Denisovan Haplotype Regulating Hypoxic Response in Tibetan Populations
"The transition to multicellularity represents a major evolutionary innovation, yet its genetic underpinnings are not fully elucidated. We reconstructed this transition using experimental evolution with the facultatively multicellular yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By selecting for larger, faster-sedimenting clusters, we evolved obligately multicellular lineages characterized by cell-cell adhesion, division of labor, and apoptosis. Integrating transcriptomics, proteomics, and chromatin accessibility data (ATAC-seq), we discovered that the evolutionary leap to multicellularity did not involve de novo gene evolution. Instead, it was driven by the wholesale co-option and rewiring of a pre-existing gene regulatory network (GRN) for nutrient-limitation stress response. Key transcription factors, previously controlling metabolic shifts, were repurposed to regulate cell adhesion and programmed cell death. This demonstrates that major evolutionary transitions can be facilitated by the recruitment of ancestral molecular machinery, providing a plausible and parsimonious pathway for the evolution of organismal complexity.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,The Evolutionary Assembly of Multicellularity via Co-option of a Unicellular Stress-Response Gene Regulatory Network
"Transposable elements (TEs) have long been considered junk DNA, but their role in shaping gene regulation is increasingly appreciated. We conducted a comprehensive comparative genomic analysis across 65 vertebrate species to quantify the contribution of TE exaptation to the evolution of cis-regulatory elements. Using phylogenetic footprinting and machine learning models trained on functional genomics data (e.g., ChIP-seq, CAGE), we identified over 200,000 TE-derived regulatory elements, including enhancers, promoters, and insulators. We found that specific TE families, such as MER and L2 retrotransposons, were repeatedly and independently co-opted into developmental gene regulatory networks at key phylogenetic nodes, coinciding with major morphological innovations like the evolution of limbs and the neocortex. Our results suggest that TEs are not merely genomic parasites but represent a vast, dynamic reservoir of sequence motifs that serve as a primary engine for regulatory innovation and macroevolutionary change.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Evolution of Genome Architecture: Transposable Element Exaptation as a Major Source of Vertebrate Regulatory Innovation
"Ecological and evolutionary dynamics are often studied independently, yet they can interact on contemporary timescales. We tested the hypothesis that rapid evolution in a prey species can fundamentally alter community-level ecological processes. In a replicated mesocosm experiment with Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata), their predator (Crenicichla alta), and associated algal communities, we manipulated predation pressure. Real-time genomic monitoring of guppy populations revealed strong, rapid selection on loci associated with escape performance and cryptic coloration, with allele frequencies shifting significantly within 10 generations. This evolution directly altered guppy foraging behavior, reducing grazing intensity on algae. As a result, mesocosms with co-evolving guppies exhibited significantly higher primary productivity and a stronger trophic cascade compared to control mesocosms with non-evolving guppy populations. This demonstrates a tight eco-evolutionary feedback loop where predator-induced evolution in prey is not just a consequence of ecological interactions but a potent driver of community structure and ecosystem function.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Eco-Evolutionary Feedback Loops: Rapid Predator-Induced Evolution Drives Trophic Cascade Dynamics
"The paradox of morphological stasis despite abundant genetic variation suggests that developmental processes may constrain evolutionary trajectories. We investigated the role of pleiotropic gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in canalizing the evolution of the tetrapod limb. By comparing single-cell transcriptomic atlases of limb development across five amniote species (chicken, mouse, anole, turtle, and alligator), we mapped the architecture of the underlying GRNs. We found that the core network topology involving key transcription factors like Shh, HoxD, and Fgf is extraordinarily conserved. In silico perturbation simulations of this network demonstrated that most mutations produced highly deleterious, non-viable phenotypes, severely limiting accessible morphospace. Viable evolutionary trajectories were restricted to modifications in peripheral, less-connected network modules or quantitative tuning of existing interactions. Our results suggest that the deep homology of this core GRN acts as a powerful developmental constraint, explaining the conserved bauplan of the tetrapod limb over 350 million years of evolution.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,The Role of Developmental Constraints in Canalizing Morphological Evolution within the Tetrapod Limb
"The evolution of altruism, where an individual incurs a fitness cost to benefit others, is a central puzzle in evolutionary theory. We examined this phenomenon in the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, where some cells altruistically die to form a stalk. Using experimental evolution and population genomics, we tracked the fate of 'cheater' genotypes that avoid contributing to the stalk. In unstructured populations, cheaters rapidly fixated. However, in populations structured to promote high kinship and periodic group formation, we observed the maintenance of cooperation. Whole-genome sequencing revealed selection for a novel 'green-beard' gene, csaA, which mediates cell-cell adhesion. Alleles at this locus enabled cooperative individuals to preferentially adhere, excluding cheaters from chimeric fruiting bodies. This demonstrates how multilevel selection, acting on both individual cells and multi-cellular aggregates, can favor the evolution of genomic mechanisms for kin recognition and policing, thereby stabilizing altruistic behavior against selfish exploitation.",1,models/gemini-2.5-pro,Evrim,Generated,Multilevel Selection and the Evolution of Genomic Altruism in a Social Amoeba
